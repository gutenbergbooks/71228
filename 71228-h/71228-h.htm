<h3>
I
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH PREFERS NOT TO DISCUSS HER OPERATION
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
You have toiled all the way here again?  Do
you know, I feel I am only <i>beginning</i> to find
out who are the <i>true</i> friends?  I am much,
much better...  On Friday I am to be
allowed on to the sofa and by the end of next
week Dr. Richardson promises to let me go
back to Mount Street.  Of course I should have
<i>liked</i> the operation to take place there&mdash;it is
one's frame and setting, but, truly honestly,
Arthur and I have not been in a position to
have any painting or papering done for so long
... The surgeon insisted on a nursing-home.
Apparatus and so on and so forth...  Quite
between ourselves, I fancy that they make a
very good thing out of these homes; but I am
so thankful to be well again that I would put
up with almost any imposition...
</p>

<p>
Everything went off too wonderfully.
Perhaps you have seen my brother Brackenbury?
Or Ruth?  Ah, I am sorry; I should have
been vastly entertained to hear what they were
saying, what they <i>dared</i> say.  Ruth did indeed
offer to pay the expenses of the operation&mdash;the
belated prick of conscience!&mdash;; and it was on
the tip of my tongue to say we are not yet
dependent on her spasmodic charity.  Also, that
I can keep my lips closed about Brackenbury
without expecting a&mdash;tip!  But they know I
can't <i>afford</i> to refuse £500...  If they, if
everybody would only leave one <i>alone</i>!  Spied
on, whispered about...
</p>

<p>
The papers made such an absurd stir!  If
you are known by name as occupying any little
niche, the world waits gaping below.  I
suppose I ought to be flattered, but for <i>days</i> there
were callers, letters, telephone-messages.  Like
Royalty <i>in extremis</i>...  And I never <i>pretended</i>
that the operation was in any sense critical...
</p>

<p>
Do you know, beyond saying that, I would
much rather <i>not</i> talk about it?  This very
modern frankness...  Not <i>you</i>, of course!
But, when a man like my brother-in-law
Spenworth strides in here a few hours before the
anæsthetic is administered and says "What <i>is</i>
the matter with you?  Much ado about nothing,
<i>I</i> call it..."  That from Arthur's brother
to Arthur's wife, when, for all he knew, he
might never see her alive again...  I prefer
just to say that everything went off most
satisfactorily and that I hope now to be better
than I have been for years...
</p>

<p>
It was anxiety more than anything else.  A
prolonged strain always finds out the weak
place: Arthur complaining that he had lost
some of his directorships and that, with the war,
he was being offered none to take their place;
talk of selling the house in Mount Street, every
<i>corner</i> filled with a wonderful memory of old
happy days when the princess almost <i>lived</i> with
me; sometimes no news from the front for
weeks, and that <i>could</i> only mean that my boy
Will was moving up with the staff.  It was
just when I was at my wits' end that he wrote
to say that he must have five hundred pounds.
He gave no reason, so I assumed that one of
his friends must be in trouble; and I was not
to tell Arthur...  This last effort really
exhausted me; and I knew that, if I was not
to be a useless encumbrance to everybody, I
must "go into dock," as Will would say, "for
overhauling and repairs."  Dr. Richardson
really seemed reluctant to impose any further
tax on my vitality at such a time, but I assured
him that I was not afraid of the knife.  So here you find me!
</p>

<p>
A little home-sick for Mount Street and my
friends?  Indeed, yes; though I have not been
neglected.  Are not those tulips too
magnificent?  <i>Were</i>, rather...  The dear princess
brought them a week ago, and I was so touched
by her sweetness that I have not the heart to
throw them away.  If <i>she</i>, to whom I can be
nothing but a dull old woman...  I mean, it
brings into relief the unkindness of others; and
I do indeed find it hard to forgive the callousness
of Spenworth and my brother Brackenbury.
No, <i>that</i>&mdash;like the operation&mdash;I would rather
<i>not</i> talk about.  Their attitude was so&mdash;wicked...
</p>

<p>
You, of course, have been under an
anæsthetic.  I?  Not since I was a child; and
the only sensation I recall was a hammer,
hammer, hammer just as I went off, which I
believe is nothing but the beating of one's
heart...  But <i>before</i> the operation...  You
must not think that I am posing as a heroine;
but accidents <i>do</i> happen, and for two days and
two nights, entirely by myself...  It was
inevitable that one should take stock...  My
thoughts went back to old days at Brackenbury,
<i>spacious</i> old days with my dear father when he
was ambassador at Rome and Vienna (they
were happy times, though the expense crippled
him); old days when my brother was a funny,
impetuous little boy&mdash;not <i>hard</i>, as he has since
become...  I am fourteen years his senior;
and, from the time when our dear mother died
to the time when I married Arthur, I was wife
and mother and sister at the Hall.  On me
devolved what, in spite of the socialists, I
venture to call the great tradition of English
life...
</p>

<p>
Lying in bed here, one could not help
saying "<i>If</i> anything goes amiss, <i>am</i> I leaving
the world better than I found it?"  Under my
own vine and fig-tree I had been a good wife
to Arthur and a good mother to Will; and, if
there had not always been <i>some</i> one of good
intentions to smoothe over difficulties with the
family on <i>both</i> sides...  Blessed are the
peace-makers, though I have sometimes wondered
whether I did right in even tolerating my
brother-in-law Spenworth.  It is probably no
news to you that he very much wanted to marry
me, but I always felt that even Cheniston, even
the house in Grosvenor Square, even his
immense income would not compensate me for
a husband whom I could never trust out of my
sight.  Arthur may be only the younger brother,
I very soon found that the old spacious days
were over; but with him one <i>does</i> know where
one is, and I have never grudged poor Kathleen
Manorby my leavings.  There indeed is a lesson
for the worldly!  She was in love with a poor
decent young subaltern named Laughton, more
suitable for her in every way; however, the lure
of Cheniston and the opportunity of being Lady
Spenworth! ... <i>He</i> transferred to an Indian
regiment; and, if his heart was broken, so much
the worse for him.  I am not superstitious;
but, when I remember that bit of treachery,
when I think of Spenworth, unfaithful from
the beginning, when I see those four dairymaid
daughters and no heir...  Might not some
people call that a judgement?  It makes no
<i>personal</i> difference, for the ungodly will flourish
throughout <i>our</i> time; and, though my boy Will
must ultimately succeed, he can look for nothing
from his uncle in the meantime.  I have lost
the thread...
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  I have done my humble best to
comfort poor Kathleen and to give her <i>some</i>
idea how to bring up her girls if she does not
want to see them going the same way as their
unhappy father.  One is not thanked for that
sort of thing; Spenworth, who blusters but can
never look me in the eyes, pretends that he
has refused to have me inside Cheniston since
I publicly rebuked him, though he well knows
that I will not enter the house while the present
licence prevails.  But one would have thought
that even he would have had serious moments,
would have felt that his soul might be required
of him at any hour...  A sense of gratitude,
if not verbal thanks, was what I expected...
</p>

<p>
Hoped for, rather than expected...  You
are quite right.
</p>

<p>
And I have tried to keep the peace on the
other side, at Brackenbury.  There, I am
thankful to say, there is the appearance of
harmony; but, goodness me, there is an
<i>appearance</i> of harmony when you see pigs eating
amicably out of the same trough...  No, I
ought not to have said that!  And I would not
say it to any one else; but, when I remember
the <i>distinction</i> of the Hall in the old, spacious
days...  My poor sister-in-law Ruth&mdash;well,
she knew no better; and Brackenbury, instead
of absorbing her, has allowed her to absorb him.
They seem to have <i>no</i> sense of their position;
and in the upbringing of their children they
either don't <i>know</i> or they don't <i>care</i>.  When
this war broke out, Culroyd ran away from Eton
and <i>enlisted</i>.  He is in the Coldstream now,
and I expect the whole thing is forgotten, but
Brackenbury had the utmost difficulty in getting
him out.  And my niece Phyllida instantly
set herself to learn nursing&mdash;which, of course,
in itself is altogether praiseworthy&mdash;, but she
makes it an excuse for now living entirely
unchecked and uncontrolled in London&mdash;the
"bachelor-girl," I believe, is the phrase.  I
did indeed force my brother to make her come
to Mount Street; but, if that preserves the
<i>convenances</i>, it is the utmost that I have
achieved.  When the trouble breaks out, when
we find her <i>liée</i> with some hopelessly unsuitable
"temporary gentleman" ... I?  In a rash
moment I allowed Brackenbury to make some
trifling contribution to the cost of the girl's bed
and board: the result is that she treats me as
a lodging-house-keeper...
</p>

<p>
It was not a cheerful retrospect; but I had
done my best, I could only say "Let me be
judged on my intentions."  The future...
That was what troubled me more.  When Will
resigns his commission, something must be
done to establish him in life until he succeeds
his uncle.  He is nearly thirty and has never
earned a penny beyond his present army pay;
<i>I</i> cannot support him indefinitely; and these
frantic appeals for a hundred pounds here and
five hundred pounds there...  I cannot meet
them, unless I am to sell the house in Mount
Street and give up any little <i>niche</i> that I may
occupy.  Frankly, I am not prepared to do that.
One's frame and setting...  If his uncles
would make a proper settlement, there would
be an end of all our troubles; failing that, I
must find him a well-paid appointment.  And,
in another sense, I want to see him established.
Exactly!  That is just what I <i>do</i> mean.  Thanks
to the energy of a few pushful but not particularly
well-connected people like my Lady Maitland,
social distinctions have ceased to exist in
London.  I will be as democratic as you please:
I swallowed the Americans, I swallowed the
South Africans, I swallow the <i>rastaquouères</i>
daily; <i>I</i> don't mind sitting between a stock-broker
and an actor, but it is a different thing
altogether when you come to marriage.  My
boy has to be protected from the ordinary
dangers and temptations; and, though I would
do nothing to influence him, it would be highly
satisfactory if he met some nice girl with a little
money of her own.  Naturally one would like
to see the choice falling on some one in his own
immediate world; but times are changing, and
it would be regarded as old-fashioned prejudice
if one made too strong a stand against the
people who really are the only people <i>with</i>
money; or against a foreigner...  But this is
all rather like crossing the bridge before one
comes to the stream...
</p>

<p>
Lying here, <i>very</i> much depressed, I wanted
to make provision for the <i>immediate</i> future.
Now, would <i>you</i> say I had taken leave of my
senses if I suggested that I had some claim on
Brackenbury and Spenworth?  Does
relationship count for nothing?  Or gratitude?  You
shall hear!  You remember that, when you left
just before my operation, Brackenbury came in
to see me.  I had sent for him.  I am not a
nervous woman; but accidents <i>do</i> happen,
and I wanted a last word with them all in
<i>case</i>... just in <i>case</i>...  Arthur never takes a
thought for the future, and I told Brackenbury
that, if anything <i>did</i> happen, he would
be the <i>real</i> as well as the titular head of the
family.
</p>

<p>
"It is not for me," I said, "to advise or
interfere with you or Ruth or your children.
If&mdash;as I pray&mdash;Culroyd comes through
unscathed, he has all the world before him, and
you have only to see that he does not marry
below his station.  With Phyllida you must be
more careful.  She is young, attractive,
well-dowered and a little, just a <i>little</i> headstrong.
The war has made our girls quite absurdly
romantic; any one in uniform, especially if he
has been wounded...  And you, who are rich,
perhaps hardly realize as well as do we, who are
poor, the tricks and <i>crimes</i> that a man will
commit to marry a fortune.  I do not suggest
that Phyllida should be withdrawn from her
hospital&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's signed on for the duration of
the war," Brackenbury interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"But I do think," I resumed, "that you
should keep an eye on her..."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there was never anything in it; but
<i>one</i> young man whom Phyllida brought to
Mount Street, a Colonel Butler, one of her own
patients...  Oh, quite a presentable, manly
young fellow, but <i>hopelessly</i> unsuitable for
<i>Phyllida</i>!  My boy Will first put me on my
guard when he was last home on leave; not that
<i>he</i> had any personal interest, for all her four
thousand a year or whatever it is, but they <i>have</i>
always been brought up like brother and sister...
My last act before coming here was to make
Colonel Butler promise not to see or communicate
with Phyllida until he had spoken frankly
to Brackenbury.  I understand that he has been
invited to the Hall "on approval", as Will
would say; and then we shall see what we shall
see.  I fancy he will have the good sense to
recognize that such an alliance would be out of
the question: every one would say that he had
married her for her money, and no man of any
pride would tolerate that...  Phyllida, robbed
of her stolen joys, was of course furious with
me for what she was courteous enough to call
my "interference." ...
</p>

<p>
"Her head is screwed on quite tight," said
Brackenbury, "though I have no idea what
you're insinuating."
</p>

<p>
"I am insinuating nothing," I said, "but
<i>do</i> you want to see your only daughter married
for her money by some penniless soldier&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"If she's in love with him, I don't care who
she marries," said Brackenbury with a quite
extraordinary callousness.  "He must be a
decent fellow, of course, who'll make her happy.
I don't attach the importance to Debrett that
you do, Ann, especially since the war."
</p>

<p>
As <i>he</i> had said it!  I was <i>mute</i>...  Every
one is aware that poor Ruth was <i>nobody</i>&mdash;the
rich daughter of a Hull shipping-magnate.  I
made him marry her because he <i>had</i> to marry
some one with a little money&mdash;and much good
it has been to anybody!,&mdash;but I hardly expected
to hear him <i>boasting</i> or encouraging his
<i>children</i> to pretend that there are no distinctions...
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's not my business, dear Brackenbury,"
I said.  I was feeling too <i>ill</i> to wrangle...
"When I asked you to come here, it was
because&mdash;accidents <i>do</i> happen&mdash;I wanted to see
you again, perhaps for the last time&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But aren't you frightening yourself
unduly?," interrupted Brackenbury.  "Arthur
told me it was only&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Arthur knows nothing about it," I said.
It is always so pleasant, when you are facing
the possibility of death, to be told that it is all
<i>nothing</i>...  "I wanted to see you," I said,
"about Will.  You and I have to pull together
for the sake of the family.  If anything happens
to me, I leave Will in your charge.  His father
will, of course, do what he can, but poor Arthur
has nothing but his directorships; you must be
our rock and anchor."
</p>

<p>
And then I plucked up courage to ask
whether Brackenbury could not do something
<i>permanent</i> for our boy.  Even a thousand a
year...  It is not as though he couldn't afford
it if Ruth shewed a little good-will, not as
though either had done so extravagantly much
for their own nephew.  Brackenbury did indeed
undertake to pay for him at Eton; but, as Will
left before any of us expected, they were let
off lightly...
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury would only talk of increasing
expenses and the burden of taxation.
</p>

<p>
"I could face my operation with an easier
mind," I said, "if I knew that Will would
never want."
</p>

<p>
"Well, some one has always pulled him out
hitherto," said Brackenbury.  "I suppose some
one always will."  I had to <i>rack</i> my brains,
but honestly truly the only occasion I could
remember on which he had come to our assistance
was when Will as a mere boy fell in with
some men no better than common swindlers who
prevailed on him to play cards for stakes which
he could not afford...  "<i>He</i> won't want,"
Brackenbury went on with the insolence of a
man who has never done a hand's turn in his
life, "if he'll only buckle down to it and work.
Or he could spend less money."
</p>

<p>
This, I knew, was a "dig" at me.  Before
my boy had time to learn how very little distance
his army pay would take him, I <i>had</i> asked my
brother to tide him over a passing difficulty.
Would you not have thought that any uncle
would have welcomed the opportunity?  I said
nothing.  And then Brackenbury had the assurance
to criticize <i>my</i> way of life and to ask why
I kept on the house in Mount Street if it always
meant "pulling the devil by the tail," as he so
elegantly expressed it.  Why did I not take a
less expensive house?  And so on and so forth.
I suppose he imagined that I could ask the
princess to come to Bayswater...
</p>

<p>
"Do not," I said, "let us discuss the matter
any more.  It is unpleasant to be a pauper, but
more unpleasant to be a beggar.  If my boy
wins through with his life&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't worry about that," said
Brackenbury.  "They tell me he's on a staff
which has never even heard a shot fired."
</p>

<p>
<i>They tell me</i>...  Does not that phrase
always put you on your guard, as it were?  Of
<i>course</i> he was quoting Culroyd, who is still
young enough to imagine that whatever he does
must be right and that every one must do as he
does.  Ever since Will was appointed to the
staff ... I should have thought it stood to
reason; you keep the <i>brains</i> of the army to direct
the war, and the <i>other</i> people...  I won't put
it even as strongly as that, but there <i>must</i> be
a division of labour.  My Lord Culroyd seems
to think that any one who has <i>not</i> run away
from school and enlisted...  Sometimes I have
been hard put to it to keep the peace when they
have been on leave at the same time.  But I
could not allow Brackenbury to make himself
a ruler and a judge...
</p>

<p>
"Is it not enough," I said, "that you have
refused the last request I may ever make?  Is
it necessary to add slander to ungraciousness?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, keep cool, Ann, keep cool," said
Brackenbury with his usual elegance.  "From
all accounts you ain't going to die yet awhile;
and, if you do, Master Will won't be any worse
off in pocket.  He can earn his living as well
as another.  I'll promise you this, though; if
he gets smashed up in the war, I'll see that he
don't starve, but that's the limit of my
responsibility.  Now, does <i>that</i> set your mind at rest?"
</p>

<p>
I refused to continue the discussion and sank
back on my pillows.
</p>

<p>
"What," I said, "what have I done to
deserve this?"...
</p>

<p>
And it was I who found Ruth for him...
</p>

<p>
Do you know, after that, it was on the tip
of my tongue to say I could not see Spenworth?
He had made such a pother about coming up
from Cheniston...  If <i>your</i> brother-in-law
were faced with an operation and begged to
have what would perhaps be his last word with
you ... and if, through no fault of yours, there
had been unhappy differences in the past...
The nurse came in to say that he had arrived,
and I felt that I must make an effort, whatever
it cost me.  He was worse than Brackenbury!
What they said to each other outside I do not
profess to know; but Spenworth came in, bawling
in that hunting-field voice of his...  Ah,
of course, you do not know him!  I assure you,
it goes through and through one's head...
I begged him to spare me; and, when I had
quieted him, I referred very briefly to our
estrangement, which, I told him, was occasioned
solely by my efforts to do what in me lay to
promote peace in the family.  Poor Kathleen
... betrayed and neglected; the licentiousness
of life at Cheniston&mdash;eating, drinking, smoking,
gambling, racing; those four <i>unhappy</i> girls...
A <i>pagan</i> household...
</p>

<p>
"But," I said, "I do not want to disinter
old controversies.  If I have failed in
achievement, you must judge me on my intentions.
Lying here, though I am not a nervous woman,
I have been compelled to think of the
uncertainty of life.  Let us, Spenworth," I said,
"bury the hatchet.  If anything happens to
me, you must be our rock and anchor.  You
are the head of the family; Arthur is your
brother; Will is your nephew&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No fault of mine," growled Spenworth
in a way that set everything trembling.  He
is obsessed by the idea that rudeness is the same
thing as humour.  "What's he been up to
now?"
</p>

<p>
"He has been 'up to' nothing, as you call
it," I said.  "But I should face my operation
with an easier mind if I knew that Will's future
was assured.  <i>When</i> the war is over and <i>if</i> he
is spared, it is <i>essential</i> that he should have
independent means of <i>some</i> kind.  It is pitiable
that a man in his position...  Do you not
feel it&mdash;your own nephew?  With the present
prices, a thousand a year is little enough; but
Arthur can do nothing to <i>increase</i> his directorships;
and if my poor guidance and support
are withdrawn&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"What <i>is</i> supposed to be the matter with
you?" Spenworth interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"I can hardly discuss that with <i>you</i>," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Brackenbury told me&mdash;and Arthur
told Brackenbury&mdash;," he began.
</p>

<p>
"Arthur and Brackenbury know nothing
about it," I said.  "For some time I have not
been well, and it seemed worth the unavoidable
risk of an operation if I might hope for greater
strength and comfort.  But I could not go
under the anæsthetic with an easy mind if I
felt that I had in any way omitted to put my
house in order.  Between us," I said, "bygones
will be bygones.  Will you not give me the
satisfaction of knowing that, if we do not meet
again, I am safe in leaving Arthur and my boy
to your care?  You <i>are</i> the head of the family.
Can my boy's future not be <i>permanently</i>
assured&mdash;here and now?"
</p>

<p>
I was not bargaining or haggling; it was a
direct appeal to his generosity...  Spenworth
hummed and hawed for a while; then he said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel very much disposed to do
anything more for that young man."
</p>

<p>
"<i>More?</i>," I echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I paid up once," he said.  "Arthur
never told you, I suppose?  Well, it was hardly
a woman's province.  I was acting <i>then</i> as head
of the family ... about the time when you
thought fit to criticize me very frankly..."
</p>

<p>
I had no more idea what he was talking
about than the man in the moon!
</p>

<p>
"Spenworth!  I must beg for enlightenment," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'll let bygones be bygones," he
answered.  "The case was never brought to
trial.  But, as long as I'm likely to be called on
to wipe up little messes of that kind, I'd sooner
make a sinking-fund, to provide against
emergencies, than pay Will money to get into more
mischief and then have to stump up again."
</p>

<p>
<i>More</i> explicit than that he declined to
be....
</p>

<p>
"Then," I said, "you repudiate all responsibility
to your own flesh and blood?  Whether
I live or die, this is a request I shall never
repeat."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'll see how things go," he answered.
"You may not be as bad as you think.  If I
find Will starving at the end of the war, I'd
undertake to pay his passage to Australia and
give him a hundred a year to stay there..."
</p>

<p>
Until you know my brother-in-law, you
cannot appreciate the <i>refinement</i> of his
humour....
</p>

<p>
"Let us," I said, "discuss this no further."
</p>

<p>
You have probably observed that a man is
never content with being <i>thoroughly</i>
ungenerous; he must always try to justify himself.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he began, very importantly,
"you wouldn't have half so much trouble with
that fellow, if you'd licked him a bit more when
he was younger..."
</p>

<p>
This from <i>Spenworth</i>!
</p>

<p>
"Who," I asked, "who made thee a ruler
and a judge?"
</p>

<p>
And then, truly honestly, I had to beg him
to leave me in order that I might compose
myself....
</p>

<p>
Compose myself!
</p>

<p>
To shew you how unnerved I had become, I
wrote down something which I had never
<i>breathed</i> to Arthur or Will.  We have always
been so poor that I had dreaded an emergency,
a sudden illness, for which I should be unable
to provide.  In Mount Street we are positive
<i>Spartans</i>!  Well, from the day of Will's birth
I have pinched and scraped, scraped and
pinched, <i>trying</i> to put something by...  A
little nest-egg...  Thirty years&mdash;nearly.  I
have never dared invest it, in case <i>something</i>
happened.  It lies at the bank&mdash;in a separate
account&mdash;ready at a moment's notice.  When
I was so ill four years ago, did I touch it?
But before my operation&mdash;in case anything
happened&mdash;I told Will the <i>amount</i> and how I
had arranged for him to be able to draw on
it.  What I tell <i>you</i> is told to the grave; I
have torn up the letter; they <i>still</i> do not know;
but, when I <i>saw</i> the amount, I was truly
tempted to say "Well done, thou good and
faithful servant" ... I have lost the
thread....
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  I was saying that my nerve had
entirely <i>gone</i>...  I was so much exhausted that
I fell into some kind of trance.  Goodness
knows the thousand and one things that go to
make up a dream...  Opposites...  All that
sort of thing...  I dreamt most wonderfully
about Will and&mdash;I wonder if you can
guess?  Phyllida!  They have been brought up
together&mdash;cousins!  She is young, high-spirited,
very, <i>very</i> attractive; and, thanks to Brackenbury's
marriage, she is well-dowered...  I said
to myself in the dream "If she could marry
happily some one in her own station..."  And
then I seemed to see her with Will...
It was but a phantasy.  I should do nothing
to encourage it, I am not at all sure that I
even approve...
</p>

<p>
Alas for reality!  Phyllida came and bullied
me for my "interference." ... But I told you
about that.  And, the day before the
operation, Arthur asked whether I really thought
it was necessary.  Like that!  At the eleventh
hour!
</p>

<p>
"I don't trust these surgeons," he said.
"They <i>make</i> operations."
</p>

<p>
At first I was <i>touched</i>...
</p>

<p>
"Dear Arthur," I said, "I am not doing
this for my amusement."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course not!," he answered.  "All
the same, I wish it could be avoided.  And, if
it can't be avoided, I wish you'd kept more
quiet about it.  I don't know what you said
to Spenworth and Brackenbury, but they're
making the deuce's own tale of it."
</p>

<p>
I begged him to enlighten me.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Arthur, "Spenworth says
that you pretended to be at death's door in
order to force him to make a settlement on
Will and that he might have consented if he
hadn't happened to know that you'd said the
same thing to Brackenbury five minutes before.
About being the head of the family and all
that sort of thing.  You know, Ann, it <i>does</i>
make us look just a little bit ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
You assure me you have seen neither
Brackenbury nor Ruth?  I just wondered who
was privileged to hear this "deuce's own tale"
... I can hardly ask you to believe it; but I
do assure you that this is the solemn truth;
those two men were seeking to convince
themselves that I was <i>pretending</i> to be ill in order
to work on their susceptible emotions!  They
seem to have had the good taste to keep their
little joke for home consumption, but you may
be sure they made merry with Ruth and
Kathleen about me...  <i>Too</i> merry, perhaps; I can
only think it was conscience that made Ruth
offer to pay for the operation.  Or perhaps it
was curiosity...  I wonder what their feelings
would have been if anything <i>had</i> gone amiss...
</p>

<p>
No, I am thankful to say there was no hitch
of any kind.  The anæsthetic was administered,
I heard that hammer, hammer, hammer&mdash;and
then voices <i>very</i> far away.  It was all over!
That was the preliminary examination.  Then
I was subjected to that too wonderful X-ray
light and saw myself as a black skeleton with a
misty-grey covering of flesh, one's wedding-ring
standing out like a black bar round one's
finger.  <i>Too</i> marvellous.  I do <i>believe</i> in this
science...
</p>

<p>
But not so marvellous as what followed.
Dr. Richardson congratulated me, and I had to beg
for enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
"It will not be necessary," he said, "to
operate after all.  The symptoms are exactly as
you described them, but a little treatment,
principally massage..."
</p>

<p>
And that is why I am still here, though I
hope to be allowed up on Friday.  But lying in
bed makes one so absurdly weak!  What I have
told you is for your ears alone.  It would be
altogether too much of a triumph for Spenworth.
Instead of feeling any thankfulness that I had
been spared the knife, he would only say...
Well, you can imagine it even from the very
imperfect sketch that I have given you.  No,
I am assured that massage makes the operation
wholly unnecessary; and I am already feeling
much, much better.  If I have not taken the
whole world into my confidence, it is partly
because I detest this modern practice of
discussing one's inside ("wearing one's stomach on
one's sleeve," as Will rather naughtily describes
it) and partly because I am altogether too
humble-minded to fancy that the entire world
is interested in my private affairs.  When the
princess asked "How did the operation go
off?," I said "Excellently, thank you, ma'am."  And
that was what all the papers published.
It was not worth while telling her that the
operation was found to be unnecessary.  I am
not of those who feel obliged to trumpet forth
that Mrs. Tom Noddy has left Gloucester Place
for Eastbourne or Eastbourne for Gloucester
Place.  As Tennyson says, "Again&mdash;who wonders
and who cares?"
</p>

<p>
At the same time&mdash;I loathe Americanisms
and I do conscientiously try to express myself
in what I may call the English of educated
society; we do not seem to have any literary
equivalent for "mentality," so I must ask you
to pardon the neologism&mdash;will you, to <i>oblige</i>
me, try to imagine the "mentality" of Spenworth
and Brackenbury?  The sister-in-law of
one, the sister of the other; <i>casting</i> about in
her resourceful mind to discover any means of
softening their hard hearts; clapping hand to
forehead; exclaiming "I have it!"; retiring
to bed; summoning the relations; making
frantic appeal; exacting death-bed promises...
</p>

<p>
Truly honestly, I don't think we have come
to that yet...
</p>

<p>
And those two men have an hereditary
right...  Thank goodness, neither of them
knows where the House of Lords <i>is</i>!  There are
moments when I feel <i>very</i> nearly a radical...
</p>

<p>
But you agree that they are hardly the
people I should wish to discuss my operation
with.  And whatever I have said to you has
of course been said in confidence.

<h3>
II
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH REPUDIATES ALL RESPONSIBILITY
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
But this is as delightful as it is unexpected!
If we only have the carriage to ourselves...
I often say that a first-class ticket is the merest
snare and delusion; during the war it has
exposed one to a new order&mdash;I've no doubt they
are very <i>brave</i> and so forth and so on, but that
sort of thing ought to be kept for the trenches.
One doesn't want to travel with it, one certainly
doesn't want to live with it...
</p>

<p>
At least <i>I</i> don't.  There's no accounting
for tastes, as my poor niece Phyllida has been
shewing.  You are going to Brackenbury, of
course?  Every one <i>does</i> by this train.  In the
old days my father enjoyed the privilege of
being able to stop every train that ran through
Brackenbury station; he held property on both
sides of the line and was a director for very
many years.  One said a word to the guard&mdash;they
were a very civil lot of men&mdash;, and that
was literally all.  My brother has allowed that
to lapse, like everything else; and you now
have to come by the four-twenty or not
at all.
</p>

<p>
I should have thought the Brackenbury
parties were difficult enough without giving
everybody a gratuitous two hours in the train
to grow tired of everybody else.  My sister-in-law
Ruth has other qualities, no doubt, but she
will not go down to history as one of the
great English hostesses...  It's not surprising,
perhaps; but, if you're not born to that sort of
thing, wouldn't you make an effort to <i>acquire</i>
it?  There must be brains of <i>some</i> kind in the
family, or the father could never have made
all that money.  I always felt a certain
responsibility about Ruth; Brackenbury <i>had</i> to marry
some one with a <i>little</i> money, and, knowing
the <i>sort</i> of girl he'd fancy if I gave him half a
chance...  I was fourteen years older and
knew something of poor Brackenbury's limitations;
when I met Ruth Philpot and found that
the money <i>did</i> come from quite a respectable
shipping firm in Hull, I said: "Marry her, my
dear boy, before you have a chance of making
a greater fool of yourself."   And I told him
I'd do what I could for her; little hints, you
understand...  I'm afraid poor Ruth was not
a very apt pupil; and Brackenbury, who never
had <i>any</i> sense of his position, was a mere broken
reed.  "Assert yourself!," I used to say.  "If
<i>you</i> don't absorb <i>her</i>, she'll absorb <i>you</i>."  That
is the only occasion on which I have ever
interfered in matters of the heart, either to guide or
check; I look at Ruth Brackenbury and say to
myself: "Ann Spenworth, you have your lesson
ever before you."  I would not urge or hinder
now, even with my own son.  Phyllida may try
to fix responsibility on me, but I repudiate
it&mdash;entirely.  In the present instance I feel that
it is, once again, the sins of the parents...
As I felt it my duty to tell them, there wouldn't
have been a moment's trouble with Phyllida,
if she had been brought up differently...
</p>

<p>
I?  Goodness me, no!  Many, many things
will have to be unsaid before Brackenbury
induces me to set foot in his house again.  <i>You</i>
know whether I am the woman to stand on my
dignity, but, when one's niece writes one letters
in the third person...  Indeed I know what
I am talking about!  "<i>Lady Phyllida Lyster
presents her compliments to Lady Ann Spenworth
and is not interested in any explanation
that Lady Ann may think fit to put forward.</i>"  These
are the manners of the war.  From the
very first I urged Brackenbury not to let her
work in that hospital; <i>some</i> one had to go, of
<i>course</i>; I'm not so foolish as to think that a
hospital would run itself without hands, but
why Phyllida?  And, goodness me, if they
couldn't stop her, they might have made a few
enquiries, exercised <i>some</i> little control...
Christine Malleson is very energetic and capable,
no doubt, but you would hardly look for standards
or traditions in <i>her</i>; however, she and my
Lady Maitland and the rest seem able to carry
people off their feet by sheer violence.  Now
Ruth and Brackenbury are paying for it.  And,
of course, poor Aunt Ann is to blame for
everything.  For the present I think it's best to
leave them severely alone.  One tries to do what
seems to be one's duty; one puts up with a
great many rebuffs; but in the end people must
be left, in the homely old phrase, to stew in
their own juice...
</p>

<p>
I'm really not sure how much is supposed
to be known.  Phyllida will no doubt tell you
her side, simply as a means of attacking me.
She works herself into such a state!  I told
Brackenbury that he ought to send her away for
a complete change...  I'm sick and tired of
the whole thing; I'm <i>sure</i> it contributed to my
illness; but, if it is going to be discussed, you'd
better hear the truth.  The whole time she was
working at the hospital, Phyllida did me the
honour to make my house her own; and, if I
questioned my own wisdom, it was because
of Will.  He would be home on leave from time
to time; and, perhaps on account of a curious
dream which I had about them at the time of
my operation, I was not at all sure that I wanted
to see the intimacy increasing; when he marries,
it will have to be some one with a <i>little</i> money,
but I do not want to lose him yet and I cannot
feel that Phyllida is very suitable...  You
can imagine, therefore, whether I should
be likely to scheme or contrive to throw them
into each other's arms; to <i>intrigue</i> to get
rivals out of the way...  I have lost the
thread.
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  Phyllida!  Now, I chose my words
carefully: "making my house her own," not
"staying in my charge."  When I went into
the nursing-home, I <i>tackled</i> Brackenbury...
</p>

<p>
"Please understand," I said, "that I accept
no responsibility.  The child goes to and from
the hospital <i>when</i> she likes, <i>how</i> she likes.  I
know nothing of the people with whom she
associates there; and, if you like the idea of her
coming in at all hours from theatres and dances,
I suppose it's all right.  But I can't stop her,"
I said; "I feel it my duty to tell you I can't
stop her."
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury made some foolish rejoinder
about Phyllida's head being screwed on tight or
her heart being in the right place.  (In that
family they <i>express</i> themselves so uncouthly.
Goodness me, one need not be a blue-stocking
to realize that English <i>has</i> a certain dignity.)  She
was only doing what every other girl did,
he said...  I'm as democratic as any one,
but I wondered what our <i>father</i> would have
said to the doctrine that his daughter might
do a thing simply because everybody else was
doing it...
</p>

<p>
You know this Colonel Butler, perhaps?
(It's only brevet-rank; if he stays on in the
army, he reverts to full lieutenant only.)  I'll
confess at once that I liked him.  When he
was convalescent, Phyllida brought him to
luncheon one day in Mount Street, and I
thought him a decent, manly young fellow.  I
understand he comes from the west of England;
and that, perhaps, accounts for the accent which
I thought I detected; or, of course, he may
simply have been not altogether at ease.  (When
I commented on it afterwards to Phyllida, she
insisted that he was very badly shaken by his
wound and the three operations...  I think
that was the first time I suspected anything;
she championed him so very warmly.)  I liked
him&mdash;frankly.  Some one quite early in the
war said something about "temporary officers"
and "temporary gentlemen"&mdash;it was very
naughty, but so true!&mdash;; I said to my boy Will,
when Colonel Butler was gone:
</p>

<p>
"If they were all like <i>him</i>, the army might
be proud of them."
</p>

<p>
"All I've met <i>are</i> like him," said Phyllida,
"only of course not so much so."
</p>

<p>
I was struggling to find a meaning&mdash;Phyllida
expresses herself almost as carelessly as her poor
mother, but with hardly her mother's excuse&mdash;,
when she began to pour out a catalogue of his
virtues: he had won a Military Cross and a
Distinguished Service Order with a bar, he was
the youngest colonel in the army, I don't know
what else.
</p>

<p>
"Who are his people?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
A name like Butler is so very misleading;
it may be all right&mdash;or it may not.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>really</i> don't know," said Phyllida, "and,
what's more, I don't care..."
</p>

<p>
She was prattling away, but I thought it
time to make one or two enquiries.  I remember
saying to poor Ruth&mdash;I forget in what
connection; life is one long succession of these
needless, irritating little encounters&mdash;I remember
saying that Phyllida was in the position of
a girl with no mother.  It's not that Ruth and
Brackenbury aren't <i>fond</i> of her, but they take
no trouble...  I asked what our young paragon's
regiment was, and you'll hardly believe me
if I tell you that it was one I had never
heard of.  Will knew, of course, but then,
on the staff, these things are brought to your
notice...
</p>

<p>
"And what is he in civil life?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
Phyllida didn't know.  His father, I think
she told me, was a surveyor, and she presumed
that he intended to be a surveyor too.  And an
excellent profession, I should imagine, with the
big estates being broken up and the properties
changing hands everywhere.  Brackenbury had
an offer for the Hall&mdash;some wealthy
contractor...  I couldn't help smiling to think how
our father would have dealt with him.  Brackenbury
let him off far too lightly, I thought, and
tried to justify himself to me by saying that it
was a very tempting offer...  As if <i>they</i> needed
money...
</p>

<p>
I had made up my mind at the outset to do
nothing precipitate.  The war has made girls
quite dangerously romantic, and any opposition
might have created&mdash;artificially&mdash;a most
undesirable attachment.  I knew that Phyllida
had these young officers through her hands in
dozens; and, though I was naturally anxious,
I knew that in a few weeks or months our
paragon would be back in Flanders or
Devonshire&mdash;out of Christine Malleson's hospital, at
all events.  I commended my spirit, so to
say...
</p>

<p>
He came to call&mdash;Colonel Butler did.  I so
little expected him&mdash;or any one else, for that
matter; the war <i>has</i> done that for us&mdash;that I'd
given no orders, and he was shewn up.
Norden&mdash;you remember him?  They took him for the
army, though I wrote a personal letter to the
War Office...  A man with varicose veins and
three small children...  Norden would have
known better, but I'd no one but maids, who
don't <i>know</i> and don't <i>care</i>...  Colonel Butler
was shewn up, still not quite at ease, and I
made myself as gracious as possible.  D'you
know, I thought it quite dear of him?  His
mother had told him that he must always call
at any house where he'd had a meal&mdash;even
luncheon, apparently, in war-time; as Will
said, when I told him, I'm glad there aren't
many wild mothers like that, roaming at large...
He sat and talked&mdash;quite intelligently; I
want to give him his due&mdash;; I rang for tea...
He hadn't learned the art of <i>going</i>...  We
got on famously until he began speaking of
Phyllida; the first time it was "your niece,"
then almost at once "Phyllida."  I said "<i>Lady</i>
Phyllida"&mdash;I must have said it three times, but
he was quite impervious.  Then Phyllida came
in and openly called him "Hilary." ... They
were dining together, it seemed, and going to
a play.  I try to conceal my palæolithic remains
in dealing with Phyllida, but I <i>did</i> say "By
yourselves?"  Oh, yes, the most natural thing
in the world...  I reminded her that Will was
home on leave, but the hint was not taken.
Off they went...
</p>

<p>
If I were not very fond of Phyllida, I
shouldn't take so much trouble about her...
And I always have to remember that Ruth is
too busy painting and powdering ever to think
of her own daughter.  I suppose she feels that
her looks are the only thing that keeps
Brackenbury enslaved...  What was I saying?  Oh,
about poor Phyllida.  It is to <i>my</i> credit that I
insisted on a proper settlement when Brackenbury
was mooning about like a love-sick boy;
she has four thousand when she's of age and
she'll have another three when the parents
die&mdash;enough, you will agree, to tempt some men.
I happened to mention at dinner that this
Colonel Butler had called, and Will became
greatly concerned.  It was quite disinterested,
because I have always felt that, if he ever
dropped the handkerchief, I could make a good
guess who would pick it up.  Will quite clearly
thought, with me, that Colonel Butler was in
earnest and that poor Phyllida was slipping into
his toils...
</p>

<p>
An opportunity came to me two or three
days before my operation.  Phyllida&mdash;she was
quite brazen about it&mdash;admitted that she had
dined with her hero four times in one week.
That was on a Saturday; I'm glad to say that
she hasn't become democratic enough to go to
these picture-houses, and there was nothing to
do on Sunday.  I told her she might ask Colonel
Butler to dine with us.  And, when he came,
I took occasion to speak rather freely to him.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help seeing," I said, "that you
are very intimate with my niece."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm devoted to Phyllida," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Then</i>," I said, "you'd cut your hand off
before you did anything to make people talk
about her."
</p>

<p>
And then I rehearsed these dinners and
plays...
</p>

<p>
"It's not my business," I said.  "Phyllida
regards me as a lodging-house keeper, but, if
your intentions are honourable, I think you
should make them known to my brother, Lord
Brackenbury." ..
</p>

<p>
Well, then he became nervous and sentimental.
He wouldn't compromise Phyllida for
the world; he'd every intention of speaking to
Brackenbury when the time came, but as long
as he was living on his pay and the war went
on...  <i>You</i> can imagine it.  He was quite
sincere.  I told you I liked him; the only thing
was that I didn't think him quite suitable for
Phyllida.  Upbringing, <i>milieu</i>...  He was no
fool; I felt he'd see it for himself before he'd
been at the Hall half an hour...
</p>

<p>
To cut a long story short, I made him
promise to hold no more communication with
the child until he'd seen Brackenbury; and I
told my brother to invite him there for a
weekend.  I didn't see very much of what happened,
as I left the young people to themselves; but
Will entirely bore out the vague, intangible
feeling...  Poor Colonel Butler <i>wasn't</i> at
home; he made my boy's life a burden for days
beforehand, asking what clothes he should take,
and, when they were there, it was "I've been
away so much that I don't know what the tariff
is since the war: if I give ten shillings to the
man who looks after me, how much ought I
to give the butler?" ... Things I should have
thought a man knew without asking.  Will was
really rather naughty about it...
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury didn't see anything amiss.
One's standard changes when one has done that
sort of thing oneself.  As I always said, "If
you don't absorb her, she'll absorb you."  And
so it's proved.  Ruth, of course, saw only the
<i>romance</i> of it all.  Goodness me, unless we're
all twins, <i>some</i> one has to be the youngest
colonel in the army...  I don't know what
people mean nowadays, when they talk about
"romance." .. Brackenbury and the whole
family made the absurdest fuss&mdash;well, I won't
say that, because I liked young Butler; they
made a great fuss.  Even my nephew Culroyd,
who's in the Coldstream, was quite affable;
"eating out of his hand" was Will's phrase.
<i>So</i> descriptive, I thought; Will has an
extraordinary knack of hitting people off...
</p>

<p>
None of them seemed to think of the money
side at all.  Brackenbury was always improvident
as a boy; but, until you've felt the pinch
as Will and I have done, you don't learn
anything about values.  Four thousand a year
<i>sounds</i> very pleasant, but if it's now only equal
to <i>two</i>...  And Phyllida has always lived up
to anything she's had.  "I want it, therefore
I must have it" has been her rule.  Clothes,
trinkets, little treats...  She has four horses,
eating their heads off, while my poor Will says
he stands hat in hand before any one who'll
mount him.  And her own little car...  I
know a brick wall when I see one; it was no
use asking Phyllida whether she thought she
could afford a husband as well as everything
else.  And a family; one has to look ahead...
Colonel Butler wouldn't be earning anything
for years.
</p>

<p>
He told me so.  I liked him more and more,
because he was so simple and straightforward.
After luncheon on the Saturday, we had a long
talk together.  I think I said I'd shew him the
house.  As you know, I yield to no one in my
love for the dear old Hall, but Colonel Butler
was like a child.  You'd have said he'd never
been inside a big house before; I don't believe
he ever had...  I took him everywhere, even
Phyllida's rooms; it was well for him to <i>see</i>, I
felt...
</p>

<p>
I remember he thanked me for having him
invited to the Hall; from his tone you'd have
said I was playing fairy god-mother, and he
credited <i>me</i> with the very friendly reception
that every one had given him.  If the truth
must be known&mdash;I wasn't taking sides; you
must understand that!&mdash;I wanted <i>them</i> to see
and I wanted <i>him</i> to see...  As Will once said,
"Half the world doesn't know how the other
half lives."  <i>I</i> felt that, when Colonel Butler
stood there, everything sinking in.  A man, I
suppose, always is rather bewildered at the
number of things a girl requires&mdash;frocks, gloves,
hats, shoes, stockings...  You mustn't think
that I shewed him Phyllida's wardrobe!
Goodness me, no!  But her maid was in the room,
getting things ready for the child's return from
hunting.  It was almost pathetic; one could
fancy the poor young man counting on his
fingers and saying: "She <i>must</i> have as good
a room as this, she'll want to keep on her
present maid, I don't suppose she can even
prepare a bath for herself or fasten her dress
or brush her hair..."  But it's better for that
kind of thing to sink in at the beginning...
Wherever I took him, he seemed to be saying:
"You can't do this sort of thing without <i>so</i>
many servants, <i>so</i> much a year." .. Will told
me that the first night at dinner...  But I'm
afraid Will's naughty sometimes...
</p>

<p>
He thanked me&mdash;Colonel Butler did&mdash;in a
way that suggested I hadn't shewn him <i>only</i>
the house.
</p>

<p>
"But I've enjoyed it," I said.  "I'm only
sorry you weren't able to go out with the rest."
</p>

<p>
He told me he didn't hunt, he'd never had
any opportunity.  There was quite a list of
things he didn't do, but he was very simple
and straightforward about them.  Don't you
dislike that <i>aggressive</i> spirit which compels
people to tell you how many they slept in one
room and the night-schools they attended and
so forth and so on?  It makes me quite hot.
I believe that's why they do it...  There was
nothing of that about Colonel Butler, though
the army had made him a little <i>borné</i>.  When
I took him to see the stables, he shewed a
certain sentimental interest in Phyllida's horses;
but his only comment was: "I wish we were
given beasts like that in the army."  And it
was the army in everything that he ate or read.
Phyllida, as you know, has travelled more than
most girls of her age; she wouldn't like to drop
that altogether on marrying; but, if you said
"Egypt" to Colonel Butler, it was simply a
place where he'd been invalided the first time
he was wounded at Gallipoli.  The war seems
to make some men curiously material...  You
understand I'm not criticizing him as a soldier;
I'm sure he did excellent and useful work, but
the war is only an <i>episode</i> in our lives...
</p>

<p>
At tea he was so silent that I felt it was
all sinking in very deep.  At the end he said:
</p>

<p>
"Lady Ann, may I ask your advice?  You
are a woman of the world&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Goodness me, no!," I said.  "Thirty
years ago I may have counted for something
there; but now I live under my own little vine
and fig-tree; I see no one; I'm out of touch;
you'd find me very old-fashioned, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"You've been very kind to me," he said,
"and I want you to add to your kindness.  I'm
in love with Phyllida, as you know; and she&mdash;I
think she quite likes me.  Lord Brackenbury
and every one here have been simply ripping.
Please tell me what you think about it."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean, will she marry you?," I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I should think it very likely," I told
him; "I wondered whether you meant, would
you make her <i>happy</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I should certainly hope to do that," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"We all <i>hope</i>," I said...
</p>

<p>
<i>My</i> responsibility is confined to giving him
a moment's pause for thought.  Phyllida will
tell you that I set him against her, poisoned
his mind, I shouldn't wonder...  It's most
charitable to recognize that she really did not
know what she was saying.  I didn't talk about
<i>him</i> at all; I talked about Will, about my
nephew Culroyd, their friends, their lives...
Any deductions were of <i>his</i> drawing; and,
goodness me, one need not be branded a snob
for seeing that they had been born and bred in
different worlds.  He seemed to think that <i>love</i>
would overcome everything.
</p>

<p>
"If you're in <i>love</i>," he kept saying, "these
things don't matter, do they?"
</p>

<p>
What made him uncomfortable was the
money question&mdash;the thought that he would
be bringing literally nothing.  I was most
careful not to say anything, but every child knows
that if you divide a sum of money by two...
He <i>would</i> be living on Phyllida; and, if he
loved her as much as he pretended, he would
always be feeling: "It's a frock for her or a
suit of clothes for me."  A very humiliating
position for any man...  I know it's the
modern fashion to pretend that it doesn't
matter; Phyllida says in so many words that
the advantage of money to a girl is that she can
marry where her heart leads her.  A snare and
a delusion, unless you mean that a woman with
money and nothing else can occasionally buy
herself <i>position</i>...  I'm sure she picked that
up from her poor mother.  But, if Brackenbury
married on his debts, he <i>did</i> bring <i>something</i>;
I know we all had to work very hard for
Ruth&mdash;"doing propaganda," as my boy Will says&mdash;to
shew people that the marriage was <i>all right</i>...
And it will be the same with Will, if he
ever marries...  Who<i>ever</i> he marries...  He
<i>does</i> bring <i>something</i>...
</p>

<p>
Colonel Butler asked if people would think
Phyllida had thrown herself away on him.
What could I say? ... But for the war, he
told me, he <i>would</i> be earning his own living;
and, do you know?, that was the only time
the cloven hoof appeared.
</p>

<p>
"We've all of us had to make sacrifices,"
I answered, "and the war ought not to be
made either an excuse or&mdash;an opportunity."
</p>

<p>
Goodness me, you don't suppose my boy
Will <i>enjoyed</i> the fatigues, the dangers...  The
general was utterly callous towards his staff;
but Will "stuck it out", as he would say.  It
was the soldier's part, and Colonel Butler knew
as well as I did that it was only the war and
the accident of being wounded that had thrown
him across Phyllida's path.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by 'opportunity',
Lady Ann?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
It was not easy to put into words...  I
sometimes feel that romance has gone to the
head of some of our girls; first of all, a man
had only to be in uniform, then he had only
to be wounded...  I <i>liked</i> Colonel Butler, but
in the old days Phyllida would not have looked
at him...  And, goodness me, if you go back
a generation, you can imagine what my father
would have said if a man, however pleasant,
with nothing but his pay and the clothes he
stood up in...  A soldier only by the <i>accident</i>
of war...  And in a regiment one had truly
honestly never heard of...
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel I can help you," I said.
"Times have changed, and my ideas are out
of date.  My brother may be different; have
you spoken to him?" ...
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact any woman could have
seen that it wasn't necessary to speak;
Brackenbury, all of them were throwing themselves
at the young man's head.  That's why I felt
that, if <i>I</i> didn't&mdash;give him a pause for
reflection, <i>no</i> one would.  No, he hadn't said
anything yet; it seemed such presumption that,
though every one was gracious to him and
Phyllida more than gracious, he wanted an
outside opinion from some one whom he was
good enough to call "a woman of the world."  Was
he justified in saying anything while his
financial prospects were so uncertain?  Was it
fair to ask Phyllida to give up so much of the
life she was accustomed to?  Would people
think he was trying to marry her for her money?
Was he entitled to ask her to wait?
</p>

<p>
I said...  Phyllida was not present, you
understand, so anything she tells you <i>can</i> only
be the fruit of a disordered imagination.  If
Brackenbury sent her right away, the whole
thing would be forgotten in two months...  I
really forget what I <i>did</i> say...
</p>

<p>
At dinner I could see that Colonel Butler
was pondering my advice.  At least, when I
say "advice", the limit of my responsibility
is that perhaps the <i>effect</i> of our little talk was
to check his natural impetuosity.  Things were
sinking in; his own good sense, more than
anything I should have dared to say...  Phyllida
came down arrayed with quite unnecessary
splendour&mdash;we were only the family and Colonel
Butler.  "Poor child," I thought to myself,
"you fancy you're attracting him when you're
only frightening the shy bird away; you imagine
he's admiring your frock when he's only wondering
how much it cost."  It was sinking in...
If poor Ruth wanted her to throw herself away
on a penniless surveyor, she might have told
her that <i>simplicity</i> was the note to strike.
Phyllida won't think for herself, and Ruth is
incapable of thinking for her.  Good gracious! at
dinner the child sat between Colonel Butler
and my boy Will; I don't encourage any girl
to become a minx, but no man thinks the better
of you for throwing yourself at his head.  A
little distance, a little indifference; until a
man's jealous, he doesn't know he's in love.
She proved my point that night, both my
points; Will was furious&mdash;and with reason&mdash;at
being so uncivilly neglected; and the young
paragon ... he was simply sated.  When the
telegram arrived...
</p>

<p>
But I thought Phyllida would have told
you about that; she has been so&mdash;immodestly
candid.  He returned to London next day,
saying he'd received a wire overnight.  I met
him the following week, and he told me.  Simple
and straightforward as ever...  He wanted to
know how Phyllida was; had Lady Brackenbury
thought him very rude?  It was one thing
or the other, he said: he could ask Phyllida to
marry him or he could go right away and
forget about her ...  until he had something
more to offer, I think he said...  You and I
know what <i>that</i> means.  He was greatly upset
and begged me to write occasionally when he
was back at the front, just to tell him how
Phyllida was; he wouldn't write to her himself,
he said, because he wanted to leave her
unembarrassed and it would be too painful for him.
</p>

<p>
"If she's still unmarried when I've made
good," he said, "it will be time to begin
writing then."
</p>

<p>
I suppose it was because Phyllida had never
been in love before...  I was ready to make
allowances, but I was <i>not</i> prepared for the
outburst, the extravagance, the self-indulgence
of grief.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, my dear!," I said, "it
would have been a very unsuitable match;
and, if you haven't the sense to realize it,
he has."
</p>

<p>
She turned on me like a fury...  I don't
know what was in his letter of good-bye; but
I suppose it was the usual romantic promise
that he'd go away and make his fortune and
then come back to claim her.  (Good riddance,
too, I thought; though I <i>liked</i> him.)  Phyllida
evidently treated it quite seriously...
</p>

<p>
"If he'd been mine for a week or a
day..." she kept sobbing.  "I know he'll be killed." ..
</p>

<p>
Well, he wasn't the only man in the world,
but nothing that I could say was right...
</p>

<p>
"I think he behaved very properly," I said.
"He did me the honour to ask my advice; and,
if I see him again, I shall tell him so."
</p>

<p>
Then the flood-gates were opened.  I&mdash;tell&mdash;you&mdash;as
I tried to tell her, but she wouldn't
let me speak&mdash;that I <i>gave</i> no advice; I wanted
him to proceed with caution, but I never even
told him to wait and think...  He did it
entirely on his own initiative.  What he quite
rightly saw was that he could not take advantage
of a young girl's infatuation to marry her for
her money.  Phyllida really shocked me with
the things she said, but I'm old enough to have
learnt patience; it will not be very long before
she begs my pardon and admits that perhaps a
certain measure of wisdom may be conceded to
age...  In the meantime I prefer not to mix
myself up in the broils and wrangles that seem
a daily feature of life at the Hall.  One makes
a certain effort; and, after that, one has to
leave people, in the homely old phrase, to stew
in their own juice...  I need hardly tell you
that Brackenbury took her side.  And poor
Ruth, though I've learnt not to expect too
much of Ruth after all these years.  If, for
curiosity's sake, you ask them what I am supposed
to have done, I should be deeply interested
to know what they say.  I have nothing but
praise for the young man.  When you are in
the army, one private is as good as another;
in hospital, you are a name, a bed, a case.  That
is so fine, I always think; it makes this truly
a <i>people's</i> war.  Colonel Butler would have gone
to the Hall sooner or later without any prompting
from me; and, once there, it was impossible
for a man of any intelligence to pretend that
there were no differences...  It is so hard for
me to put it into words without seeming a snob,
but <i>you</i> understand what I mean...
</p>

<p>
You will find my boy Will there.  He never
seems to come home without picking up a cold,
and the doctor has very sensibly recommended
that he should be given an extension of leave.
I was <i>not</i> very much set on his going, I admit.
Goodness me, any silly little ill-bred things that
Phyllida may pick up from her poor mother are
forgotten as soon as they are said; I have no
need to stand on my dignity.  The sins of the
fathers...  Brackenbury <i>never</i> checks her...
But you know what a girl is when she has had
a disappointment, we must both of us have seen
it a dozen times ... some sort of natural recoil.
If she throws herself at Will's head...  With
her money they'd have enough to live on, of
course, and young people ought to be very
comfortable on four thousand a year.  (It will
be seven, when the parents die.)  One need
not look ahead to a family; but the grandfather,
Ruth's father, would not be illiberal.  But,
though dear Will must marry some day, I dread
the time when I must lose him...

III
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH TOUCHES RELUCTANTLY ON DIVORCE
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
I have been brought up in a different school,
that's all.  "Whom God hath joined..."  I
don't ask any one to share my feelings and I'm
not so foolish as to say I won't receive people
who have taken a step which is at least legal,
however much one may deplore the present ease
of divorce.  I do indeed try to differentiate in
my attitude towards the guilty party, but in
this I am more than ever "ploughing a lonely
furrow," as my boy Will rather picturesquely
expresses it...
</p>

<p>
Nowadays it is unfashionable to heed the
teachings of religion; but I should have thought
that the least consideration for patriotism,
stability...  My father's maxim was that family
life is the <i>basis</i> of the state and that, when
once you sanction the principle of divorce, you
are undermining the foundations of the
commonwealth.  So I have at least been consistent...
</p>

<p>
That is perhaps more important than you
think.  The cynic cannot see that one's
principles are independent of personal
considerations.  If they ever have the ill fortune to
coincide even in appearance...  Indeed yes!
I happen to know what I am talking about...
Forgive me if I spoke sharply; but one's nerves
are not of iron, and it is not pleasant to be
charged with conspiracy by the members of
one's own family.  Oh, not Spenworth!  We
have hardly met for years, I am thankful to say,
though my husband has more than once tried
to bring about a reconciliation.  I have no
personal animus; but, if the head of an honoured
family chooses to drag his name in the mire,
he shall at least not say that he has had
countenance or support from even so humble a person
as his sister-in-law.  I was referring to the other
side, my own people; I have an unforgiving
little enemy, I fear, in my niece Phyllida; I
should mind that less if Brackenbury and his
poor wife did not seem to aid and abet her.
Loyalty to the family, I should have thought...
But, once again, I was brought up in a
different school.  I have told my brother, until
I am tired, he ought to send her <i>right</i> away.
It was a disappointment...  Goodness me, it is
a disappointment when one cries for the moon;
and, though I thought this Colonel Butler a
decent, manly fellow, he was really nobody.
He saw, without my telling him, that every one
would say he was marrying her for her money...
I won't call it an <i>escape</i> for Phyllida, because
that always sounds so spiteful.  But I will allow
no one to say I made him throw her over so
that I might keep her for my own boy!
</p>

<p>
I want you to tell me frankly how much you
have heard.  <i>Literally</i> nothing?  Then you
<i>will</i>&mdash;the very next time you go to the Hall.  Not
satisfied with inventing this abominable story,
Phyllida feels it her duty to inflict it upon any
one who will listen.  But you must have seen
about the divorce?  Not even that?  Well, you
are wise; these things are unsavoury reading.
The case was tried in the summer&mdash;"Spenworth's
washing-day", as my boy called it&mdash;,
and the decree will be made absolute in a few
weeks' time.
</p>

<p>
It is the fashion to say that my brother-in-law
was more sinned against than sinning.
Does not that formula always put you on your
guard, so to say?  He was a mere boy when
he succeeded to the title; an immense estate
like Cheniston offered too many temptations;
his good looks made him a prey for all the
harpies; he was too kindly ever to say "no"
even to the most dissolute of his associates.
And so forth and so on...  Goodness me!
Arthur&mdash;my husband&mdash;was two years younger;
and, if his old father's iniquitous will did not
leave him enough money to tempt the hangers-on,
at least he did not play ducks and drakes
with what he had.  It is more a question of
character than of income.  And Arthur had his
share of good looks, as you can see from Will.
No!  Whatever Spenworth did, he could always
buy indulgence.  Establish for yourself the
reputation of "a good fellow"&mdash;whatever that
may mean&mdash;; and you will walk on roses all
your life...
</p>

<p>
One must assume that <i>he</i> thought the
marriage would be a success, but I am sure no
one else did.  I <i>knew</i> Spenworth, you see.  It
is ancient history now, but it was only when I
destroyed his last hope by marrying Arthur
that he turned in desperation to Kathleen
Manorby ... after remaining disconsolate for
nearly ten years.  For her and her like my
Will coined the description "chocolate-box
beauty."  She is still attractive after twenty
years...  I tried to warn her, so far as one
could without having one's motives misconstrued;
but she was glamoured by the money
and the title.  She had several offers, I believe,
from men rather more in her own <i>milieu</i>, but
it was a case of not being able to afford the
luxury of marrying a poor man.  Otherwise her
first love, young Laughton, who broke his heart
over her and transferred to the Indian Army...
I warned her that Spenworth would be
unfaithful before they had been married a year,
but she was too sure of her own charm and
power.
</p>

<p>
Within a year!  Within three months...
Kathleen is a fool, but one may feel for any
woman who has had to put up with so many
sordid humiliations.  If she had borne him a
son, it might have been different, but one girl
after another...  Four of them, and no heir to
Cheniston.  Superstitious people would tell you
that it was a judgement on Spenworth for his
past life and on her for her treatment of poor
young Laughton...  And, little by little,
Spenworth seemed to lose all regard for human
decency, until one was tempted to forget poor
Kathleen's disappointment and to feel that
Providence had decided that no son of his
should ever reign in his stead.  I am utterly
free from superstition myself; but it did seem
curious...  He, I fancy, never quite gave up
hope; as I felt it my duty to tell him, he was
on such good terms with this world that he
could not imagine another world in which his
behaviour might be less leniently regarded.
When the <i>fourth</i> girl was born and we realized
that Will <i>must</i> ultimately succeed, I suggested
that something might now be done to enable
our boy to live in a manner befitting the heir
to an historic title.  Spenworth gave one of his
great laughs and begged me to wait until he
was dead before I cast lots for his raiment,
adding that he had no intention of dying yet awhile.
The usual blend of arrogance and blasphemy...
</p>

<p>
Yes, my husband is the only brother.  It is
a matter of rather less than no interest to either
of us, for Spenworth will last our time.  His
constitution is proof against even his own
assaults on it.  Besides, one would hate the
idea of waiting to step into a dead man's shoes...
So really the heir is Will, but <i>he</i> is in no
hurry; Cheniston is a night-mare to him, he
does not <i>desire</i> the place.  Perhaps he dreads
having to cleanse the Augean stable.  You have
never stayed there, of course; I can say
without unkindness that, wherever a naked savage
could have made one error in taste, poor
Kathleen has made three...
</p>

<p>
It was Will who brought the news that a
divorce was pending.  One <i>guessed</i> that
Spenworth and Kathleen were living apart, but she
had let slip so many opportunities...  One asked
oneself what new provocation could have roused
her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's a put-up job," said Will.  "As
Aunt Kathleen hasn't produced a son, Spenworth
wants to get free of her and marry some
one else.  A man at the club told me that he
was allowing her twenty thousand a year for his
liberty."
</p>

<p>
Really and truly, the interest that total
strangers take in other people's affairs the
moment that sinister word "divorce" is
pronounced...  Within two days the story was on
every one's lips: Spenworth was the one topic
of conversation, and everything was known.  I
think it is called a petition for restitution.
Alas! for twenty years it would always have
been easy to produce evidence of Spenworth's
vagaries; now, I gathered, he was to "desert"
Kathleen and then refuse to obey some order
to come back.  I don't profess to understand
the subject; it is wholly distasteful to me...
</p>

<p>
"And what then?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"A decree <i>nisi</i>," Will told me.  "I gather
my next aunt has been chosen already."
</p>

<p>
I will not mention her name.  She who
marries a man that has been put away...
Perhaps I take too lofty a view of human nature,
knowing my brother-in-law as I do; but, until
he <i>actually</i> marries her, I shall continue to look
for a sign of grace.
</p>

<p>
"And now perhaps Cheniston is going to
have an heir after all," said Will.
</p>

<p>
I confess that I was thinking not at all of
Cheniston at this season, though a second
marriage may revolutionize everything.  The
shame of seeing my husband's elder brother,
the head of an historic family, in the Divorce
Court...  And already thinking of another
union with goodness knows who; and, once he
begins, there is no reason why he should ever
stop.  I am told that there are more than two
thousand cases waiting to be tried.  The war!
I always felt that you could not have an
upheaval on that scale without paying for it
afterwards.  There are moments when I feel
glad that my dear father did not live to see this
<i>bouleversement</i>...  Mere beasts of the field...
</p>

<p>
"I cannot discuss this," I told Will.
</p>

<p>
My husband had heard the story too and
was so much shocked that I dared not allude
to it.  We could <i>do</i> nothing...
</p>

<p>
I <i>did</i> make one effort.  I tried to persuade
my brother to reason with her.  The opinion
of an outsider&mdash;and Brackenbury has the
reputation, not perhaps very well-founded, if you
consider his own life, of being a man of the
world...  He would only say that, though
"dear old Spenworth" was "no end of a good
fellow", he was also "no end of a bad
husband" and that, if Kathleen had had sense or
spirit, she'd have divorced him a dozen years
ago.  Then, against my own inclinations, I
went to see Kathleen and literally begged her
to reconsider her decision before it was too
late.  One might as profitably have spoken to
the dead...
</p>

<p>
She was not antagonistic in any way.  Indeed,
our meeting would have been profoundly
interesting, if it had not been so painful.  She
was still in love with Spenworth.  Men like
that, dissolute and unfaithful, seem to have an
animal magnetism which holds certain women
in complete subjection.  Kathleen was <i>miserable</i>
at the thought of parting from her scamp of
a husband.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't do it if I didn't love him,"
she cried.
</p>

<p>
And, if you please, I was left to understand
that she was effacing herself, giving him up and
making way for another woman simply because
she fancied that he would be happier.  I confess
I should have had little patience with her, if
she had not been so pitiable.  Life was a blank
without Spenworth.
</p>

<p>
"Then why," I asked, "do you cut your
own throat and drag the name of the family
through the mire?  Have you <i>no</i> sense of your
position after all these years, <i>no</i> feeling for the
rest of us?"
</p>

<p>
"It's for him," she said.
</p>

<p>
And I verily believe that, if he had told
her literally to cut her throat, she would have
done it...
</p>

<p>
I have never been greatly attached to Kathleen.
These backboneless, emotional women...
But I felt that <i>some</i>body must do <i>some</i>thing
for her.  She came to Mount Street, and I
reasoned with her again; at Cheniston I may
be less than the dust, but under my own vine
and fig-tree...  In London I <i>have</i> a certain
<i>niche</i> and I was bound to warn her that a
divorced woman is <i>mal vue</i> in certain circles
and among certain persons who sometimes do
me the honour to dine at my house.  There
would be occasions on which I should be unable
to invite her.  You would have said that she
didn't care...  She was staying with us when
the case was tried; she stayed all through the
summer, four months.  No, you mustn't give
me credit to which I'm not entitled.  I felt
very little sympathy when she proved obdurate;
but, if one <i>could</i> do anything to brighten her
lot...  I gave one or two little parties...
Trying to take her out of herself.  To some
extent I succeeded.  Kathleen has still the
remains of good looks, though that fair fluffiness
is not a type that I admire.  When I refused
to let her sit and mope in her room, she made
an effort and assumed quite an attractive
appearance.  Several men were impressed...
</p>

<p>
There was one in particular.  I won't give
you his name...  And yet I don't know why
I shouldn't; if Phyllida persuades you to listen
to her story, I am sure she will spare you
nothing.  He was introduced to me as Captain
Laughton; and the name conveyed nothing to
me until some one reminded me of the old
boy-and-girl attachment before Kathleen married
Spenworth, when this man Laughton pretended
to be heart-broken and disappeared to Central
India.  They had not met for twenty years, but,
when he read of the divorce proceedings, I can
only assume that he sought her out.  Will met
him at his club, I think, and the man virtually
invited himself to come and dine.  I was not
greatly enchanted by him at our first meeting,
but he was a new interest to Kathleen (I knew
nothing until <i>days</i> afterwards when I tackled
her about her really unaccountable behaviour
with him)...  And I must confess that there
were moments when poor Kathleen was a grave
trial and I repented my impetuosity in asking
her to stay with us.  Captain Laughton came a
second time and a third.  By the end of a
month he had really done us the honour to
make our house his own...
</p>

<p>
There are things I can say to you that I
would never breathe to a man.  I, personally,
never make a mystery of my age; you will find
it in all the books, every one knows I am six
years older than Arthur, four years older than
Spenworth&mdash;why conceal it?  I wished Kathleen
could have been equally frank, could have
seen herself as I saw her.  She is within a
few months of thirty-nine, with four strapping
girls; one does expect a certain dignity and
restraint at that age.  I know what you are
going to say!  We of the older generation
<i>usually</i> expect more than we receive.  I have
learnt that lesson, thank you!  Kathleen seemed
to fancy that she was back in the period of this
boy-and-girl attachment to which I have alluded.
She and Captain Laughton were inseparable.
He took her to <i>dances</i> ... as if she were
eighteen!  Indecent, I considered it.  And I
wondered what her girls thought of their mother,&mdash;if
they're capable of thinking at all.  I don't
associate <i>brains</i> with that chocolate-box beauty...
Dances, dinners, little expeditions.  Every
one was beginning to smile...
</p>

<p>
"If she's not careful," Will said to me one
day, "she'll cook her own goose as well as
Spenworth's."
</p>

<p>
I had to ask him to express his fears in
simpler language.
</p>

<p>
"There <i>is</i> such a person as a King's
Proctor," he said, "though they don't seem
aware of it.  If she plays the fool with
Laughton, the decree won't be made absolute; and
she and Spenworth will be tied to each other
for the rest of their lives.  That would hardly
suit <i>their</i> book."
</p>

<p>
Do you ever feel that you have strayed into
a new world?  The fact of divorce...  And then
this light-hearted pairing off: Spenworth with
some woman who had been setting her cap at
him for years, Kathleen with the love of her
youth.  They had lost all reverence for marriage,
the family; it was a game, a dance&mdash;like
that figure in the lancers, where you offer your
right hand first and then your left...  I made
Will explain the whole position to me again
and again until I had it quite clear in my
mind.  The King's Proctor, as he described
him&mdash;rather naughtily&mdash;, was "a licensed
spoil-sport", who intervened in cases where the
divorce was being arranged by collusion or where
both parties had sinned.
</p>

<p>
"The office seems a sinecure," I commented.
</p>

<p>
Those two thousand petitions...  They stick
in my throat.
</p>

<p>
"As a rule people don't take risks," Will
explained.  "And it's not often to the
advantage of an outsider to come in and upset the
apple-cart.  You or the guv'nor or I," he said,
"could do a lot of mischief, if we liked; but
we're interested parties, and it wouldn't look
well."
</p>

<p>
I confess that I did not share his tenderness
towards what is nothing but a life of
premeditated sin...  Yes, I know it's <i>legal</i>, but
Parliament can make a thing legal without
making it <i>right</i>.  The whole subject, however,
was very distasteful, and I did not pursue it.
That night I let fall a hint to Arthur, but he
was not disposed to take any action.
</p>

<p>
"She's a bigger fool than I took her for,"
was all he would say.  "She's endangering her
own future and Spenworth's and playing into
our hands if we chose to take advantage of our
opportunity."
</p>

<p>
Whether Arthur spoke to her or not, I
cannot say; but I know that she received a very
frank warning from her own solicitors.  Spenworth,
too, did us the honour to write and say:
"<i>For heaven's sake keep that</i>&mdash;" I forget the
actual phrasing&mdash;"<i>keep that man away from
Katie, or he'll do us in</i>."  Spenworth was
always noted for his elegance of diction...  If
a pawn could speak, I'm sure its feelings would
be very much what mine were: pushed hither
and thither in a game that I did not begin to
understand.  <i>I</i> had never asked Captain Laughton
to the house; he invited himself, and by
the same token I knew that it was no good
telling him to stay away.  My house was not
my own, my soul was not my own.  And I
had that hopeless sense that, whatever I did, I
should be wrong...
</p>

<p>
It was a trying season...  Their behaviour
was so extraordinary!  I pinched myself and
said: "<i>This</i> is the woman who cried to you
because she was losing Spenworth, because the
light was being taken out of her life.  She was
sacrificing herself to make Spenworth happy!"  I
admit that I was taken in.  She may have
been sincere at the time, but that is only the
more discreditable.  To cry for Spenworth one
day and for her Captain Laughton the next...
I use the word literally; if a single day passed
without her seeing him, she moped&mdash;for all
the world like a love-sick girl who thinks her
sweetheart is tiring of her.  And when they met...
</p>

<p>
I have told you that people were beginning
to smile, and that should have been humiliating
enough to a woman who has achieved at least a
dignity of <i>position</i>; one said that there was
nothing in it, but that had no effect.  Anything
connected with divorce seems to breed a morbid
curiosity; they were being spied on, whispered
about; people who did not wait to consider that
Kathleen was nearly forty assumed that she
would inevitably marry again and decided no
less obstinately that she would marry Laughton.
Then the tittle-tattle press laid hold of her.  I
am told that certain women, probably known
to both of us, earn a <i>livelihood</i> by collecting
gossip at one's dinner-table and selling it at so
much a scandal to these wretched papers.  One
is quite defenceless...  I noticed for myself&mdash;and
others were indefatigable in shewing me&mdash;little
snippets saying that Lady Spenworth and
Captain Laughton had been seen at this or that
garish new restaurant.  I believe that Kathleen's
solicitors wrote to her a second time...
</p>

<p>
A man at such a season does occasionally
contrive to keep his head, but Captain
Laughton was no less blind and uncontrolled than
Kathleen.  Will and I had arranged to go
away for a few days' motoring at the end of
the summer.  A car <i>and</i> unlimited petrol&mdash;for
the first time since the war&mdash;; Sussex; the
New Forest; perhaps a day in Dorset to take
luncheon with the Spokeleighs; Wiltshire,
Gloucestershire and up into Hereford.
Delightful...  We had planned it months
ahead&mdash;before this unhappy divorce.  The problem of
Kathleen called for solution; we could not
conveniently take her in the car, and, if I left her
in Mount Street, I did want to be assured that
there would be no unpleasantness...
</p>

<p>
"Captain Laughton," I said one night,
when he had telephoned to know whether he
might dine.  It was on the tip of my tongue
to say: "My good man, don't ask <i>me</i>!  Refer
your invitations to my cook..."  He was such
a <i>boy</i> that I never spoke to him as I truly
honestly think he deserved...  "Captain
Laughton," I said, "will you promise that,
while I'm away, you won't come here or try
to see Lady Spenworth?  She is in a position,"
I said, "where you can easily compromise her;
a severer critic might say that you had compromised
her already.  If you have her interests at
heart, you have a chance of proving your
friendship to her..."
</p>

<p>
Am I unduly idealizing the past if I say that
in my youth it would have been unnecessary to
speak like that to any man?  Captain Laughton
was no longer a boy...  Assuredly, in the school
in which I was brought up, if one <i>had</i> spoken,
one's word would have been law...
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lady Ann, I've been talking to
Kitty about that," he answered.  I think
"jaunty" is the word to describe his manner;
great assurance, good humour, no thought that
any one would even dream of giving him a
rebuff.  "We were thinking," he continued,
"that it would be such fun if we could come
too.  I have a car, we wouldn't get in your
way; but we can hardly go off unattended, and
I quite agree with what you say about not
compromising Kitty in London."
</p>

<p>
He took my breath away.  We this, we
that.  Perhaps I shall take away yours if I tell
you that I acquiesced in his really impudent
proposal.  Not without a struggle, you may be
sure; and not without declaring my own terms.
If there were any unpleasantness, <i>I</i> should be
held responsible.  I ordained that, if I had to
play the dragon, I would be a dragon in
earnest; Kathleen should come in my car, while
my Will went with Captain Laughton.  Can't
you picture how the other arrangement would
have worked out?  The two of them mooning
like rustic lovers, forgetful of time and
everything else, the car breaking down to
prolong their stolen joy...  My dear, you could
see it in their faces when I launched my
ultimatum...
</p>

<p>
And you could see it a hundred times a day
when our tour began.  Any excuse to slip away
and be together.  When I suggested a <i>détour</i>
to call on Sir Charles Spokeleigh, I was told at
once that Captain Laughton did not know him
and that Kathleen disliked his wife&mdash;or had a
head-ache, I forget which.  Kathleen always
had a head-ache if one suggested a little
constitutional before dinner.  And Captain Laughton
insisted on staying behind with her.  There
was no great harm, perhaps, in an out-of-the-way
village which had escaped the contamination
of the London press, but in places like
Dorchester, Gloucester, Hereford...  One was
known; the papers would announce us among
the new arrivals: "Lady Spenworth, Lady Ann
Spenworth, Captain Laughton..." and so on
and so forth.  They could not afford to take
the slightest risk.  If I had yielded to their
entreaties and then the car had broken down...
The King's Proctor or whoever he is
would never believe that it was an accident
and that they were truly innocent.  There
would be the record in the register of the
hotel...
</p>

<p>
I am thankful to say that we were spared
all catastrophes; and I frankly enjoyed the
tour, though it was impossible to escape a
feeling of conspiracy.  The only hitch occurred at
the end as we came within thirty miles of
Brackenbury.  The roads there are not all that
could be desired, and I should not have
contemplated for a moment the cross-country
journey, were it not that I saw an opportunity
of healing the unhappy breach with my niece
Phyllida.  At present she is so terribly and
unjustly bitter that there is nothing she will not
believe and say.  It occurred to me that, if I,
the older woman, made the first advance...
A gracious phrase or two, telling her that I
could not pass her home&mdash;my <i>old</i> home&mdash;with
the feeling that any rancour remained...
You understand.  It is always worth a little
inconvenience to be gracious...  And she
had been speaking quite wickedly about me...
</p>

<p>
We lunched that day at Norton and had
arranged to sleep at Rugely.  I need hardly say
that, when I suggested a <i>détour</i> to Brackenbury&mdash;an
extra forty miles at most&mdash;, Kathleen
discovered that she was tired out and Captain
Laughton trumped up his usual excuse that he
didn't know my brother and disliked "butting
in" on strangers...  Ridiculous!  I've never
met a man more completely self-possessed...
For once I broke my rule and said that they
might go on by themselves and order rooms for
us in Rugely.  They would leave a note for us
at the General Post Office to say where we
should meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Drive carefully!," Captain Laughton
called out, as we started from Norton.  "It
will be the devil and all, if anything happens
to you."
</p>

<p>
I did not understand this new-born solicitude
until my boy Will undertook to enlighten
me.  And then I saw that perhaps I had been
really imprudent.  After a fortnight of
heart-breaking discretion, I <i>had</i> allowed these two
feather-brained creatures to drive off alone...
If they failed to secure rooms and could not
communicate with us in time...  If for any
reason we did not meet at the <i>rendez-vous</i>...
I can assure you that I gave myself a
headache, just thinking of one possible disaster
after another.  It would <i>not</i> have passed
unnoticed; we had received ample evidence of
that.  Most dreadful misconstructions would be
placed on their conduct&mdash;and on mine.  The
King's Proctor&mdash;really, the <i>name</i> is so absurd;
one makes a mental picture of some strange
court functionary taken straight from the pages
of that delightful Lewis Carroll book&mdash;I became
haunted by visions of the King's Proctor
intervening to stay the divorce proceedings.  And
then, as Will said so lucidly, Spenworth and
Kathleen would be tied to each other for the
rest of their lives; gone would be her
St. Martin's summer of romance, gone would
be&mdash;no, romance is always to me a singularly
beautiful word; I decline to associate
it with what my boy calls Spenworth's
latest shuffle of the matrimonial pack.  The
worst thing of all was that we should be held
responsible.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what Spenworth would do if the
positions were reversed," said Will.  "If the
guv'nor were elder brother and wanted an heir,
if <i>he</i> had the chance of stopping it and keeping
the inheritance for himself...  I wonder if he'd
be able to resist."
</p>

<p>
"Temptation only seems strong to those
who do not wish to withstand it," I said.
</p>

<p>
Our arrival at the Hall was hardly auspicious,
as my head-ache had been growing so steadily
worse that I had to ask my sister-in-law Ruth
to let me lie down if there was to be any
question of my driving on to Rugely.  And,
though I felt better after a cup of tea, the pain
returned when I was left for a moment with
Phyllida.  I sought an opportunity for my little
speech.  Phyllida...  It would be absurd to
feel resentment against a mere child whose
nerves were obviously unstrung, but I wondered
then and I wonder now what <i>my</i> dear mother
would have said if I had spoken, looked,
behaved in such a way to <i>any</i> older woman.
When she had <i>slammed</i> her way out of the
room, I sank into a chair, trembling.  <i>You</i>
know whether I am a limp, nervous woman;
when Ruth came in to ask&mdash;without a spice of
welcome&mdash;whether we would not stay to dinner,
I was too much upset to speak; I just nodded...
If I had been stronger, I would not have
remained another moment in the house; but
Will had disappeared, and I was unequal to
returning alone.
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury had the consideration to ask if
I would not stay the night.  I explained the
very delicate position in which we had left
Kathleen and Captain Laughton.
</p>

<p>
"Well, go if you feel up to it," said
Brackenbury in what I thought was an off-hand
manner to adopt to his sister.  "Or send Will,
if anybody can find what's happened to him.
So long as they've <i>some</i> one to chaperon them,
they're all right."
</p>

<p>
I would have stayed if Will could have
stayed with me.  I would have gone if that
had been the only means of keeping by his side.
Do you know, I had the feeling that in the
length and breadth of that house he was the
only one who cared whether I was well or ill,
whether I lived or died ... almost...
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that I <i>care</i> to leave my
mother while she's like this," said my boy
rather timidly, when he was fetched in to join
the council.  It is unfashionable, I believe, for
the modern son to shew his mother any overt
tenderness...
</p>

<p>
"Well, some one's got to go," said
Brackenbury with unnecessary impatience.
"It's all up, if you leave those two without
any one to keep them in countenance."
</p>

<p>
"We will both go," I said.
</p>

<p>
When the car was ordered, we went into
the hall and waited...  After about twenty
minutes Brackenbury rang to find out the
reason for the delay.  The servant came back to
say that part of what I think is called the
magneto was missing.  I chose my word
carefully: not "injured" or "worn-out," but
"missing"&mdash;as though some one had invaded
the garage and removed the requisite part...
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury seemed to lose his head altogether.
</p>

<p>
"It's ten o'clock," he roared.  "If you
don't get to Hugely by mid-night, can't you
see that you'll be too late to stop a scandal?
If you <i>want</i> to stay the divorce, say so at once,
say that you're scheming to tie up Spenworth
in your own interests; and, by God, if it comes
off, <i>I</i>'ll say it until every decent man and
woman will walk out of a room when any of
your gang come into it...  Phyllida," he
shouted.  "Order your car!  Will can drive
it..."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you afraid he may lose his way?,"
asked Phyllida.
</p>

<p>
I don't attempt to reproduce her voice...
It was silky ... oh, and wicked!  I <i>tell</i> myself
not to mind, I try to remember that she was
overwrought and that her father was a criminal
not to insist on her going away.  Phyllida was
deliberately charging us with a conspiracy to
interrupt the divorce proceedings so that in
time&mdash;goodness me, when Arthur and I are dead
and buried!&mdash;our boy Will might succeed.
Cheniston is a noble seat; the Spenworth title
is old and was once honoured; but neither for
my husband nor my son do I want them&mdash;at
that cost.
</p>

<p>
I said nothing...  I believe I murmured to
myself: "You wicked child"; but, literally, I
couldn't speak.  I couldn't see ... or hear.
Brackenbury was making furious arrangements.
As in a dream I saw Ruth being wrapped in a
fur-coat...  A car came to the door and drove
away...  I asked my boy to ascertain which
was my room and to lend me the support of
his arm up the stairs...
</p>

<p>
Ruth telegraphed next day from Rugely&mdash;just
two words&mdash;"<i>All well</i>." ...
</p>

<p>
Will and I returned to London by train.
Phyllida was in the hall, reading the telegram,
as I appeared.
</p>

<p>
"It nearly came off," she said.  "I'm
sorry&mdash;for your sake&mdash;that you've had a
disappointment.  Time, you will find, works
wonders; and some day, perhaps, you will be
more grateful than I can expect to find you
now.  If I were you, I would go right
away..."
</p>

<p>
What she <i>intended</i> to convey I have no
more idea than the man in the moon...  The
night before, her meaning was <i>never</i> in doubt;
and I am waiting for her to put it into words,
to charge Will or me or both of us with
deliberately damaging our car...
</p>

<p>
But you will see that anything she says in
her present state, poor child, must be accepted
with charitable reserve.

IV
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH IS CONTENT WITH A LITTLE MUSIC
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
I am easily satisfied, I ask for nothing better
than a little music after dinner.  If only the
rising generation were <i>rather</i> less self-conscious...
When I was a girl, it was a law of the
Medes and Persians that, if any one asked us
to play or sing, we at <i>once</i> complied.  None of
this modern absurdity of not playing in public,
insisting on the hush of the grave, looking
round the room first to see if by chance there
is some great <i>maestro</i> present...  When I tell
you that I once sang before Jenny Lind, being
too young and ignorant to know who she was...
And no one could have been sweeter...
</p>

<p>
I am not a musician in any sense of the
word.  (I am almost tempted to add: "Thank
goodness!")  When one sees and hears the
devotees at Covent Garden, talking a language
of their own which I am quite sure half of them
don't understand, ready to set one right in a
moment if one <i>presumes</i> to offer an opinion...
If any one said to me: "I want to be a social
success and I don't know how to begin," I
should answer: "Learn the musical jargon and
use it <i>rudely</i>, especially to people who for one
reason or another have not had to <i>fight</i> their
way into any little <i>niche</i> that they may
occupy."  I won't mention names...  But I
see you have guessed!  And do you not agree?
That man, for all his millions, would be received
<i>nowhere</i> but for his alleged love of music; but
take a double box at the opera, go every night,
allow yourself to be seen at all the concerts, give
immense parties of your own, support and bring
out three new geniuses a month&mdash;everything is
forgiven you!
</p>

<p>
I did not know him before the war ... when,
by the way, I understand he passed by
the name of Sir Adolf Erckmann.  One saw,
indeed, his not very prepossessing beard and
bald head protruding from his box&mdash;a red,
anxious face and single eye-glass, positively
<i>scattering</i> bows right and left at the people he
had succeeded in getting to know in his upward
progress.  Originally, I believe, a German-Jewish
banker, with immense interests of all
kinds in every part of the world and a very
unsavoury domestic reputation.  He was nothing
to me, nor I to him; and it would have been
no true kindness for me to "take him up," as
Connie Maitland was always urging me to do.
No doubt we should have been surfeited with
invitations to Westbourne Terrace and Rock
Hill; but we are not <i>yet</i> reduced to scouring
London for free meals, like some people we
could think of, and, without being cynical, I
always felt that the Erckmanns would try to
use us as a means of getting to know Spenworth
and Brackenbury so that in time their triumphal
progress might carry them to Cheniston and the
Hall.  If I could have done any good, it would
have been a different matter; but you remember
the Erckmanns were a test-case before the war,
in the days when the energy of Christine
Malleson and my Lady Maitland and the rest
had broken down so many barriers which
hitherto had been at least a convenience.  Not
only Spenworth and Brackenbury, but a dozen
more as good as said that they could not
continue to know me if I consented to know
Erckmann...
</p>

<p>
When the war came, things materially
altered.  The Erckmanns vanished&mdash;in every
sense of the word.  The old friends, who had
<i>plagued</i> me to receive him, now denied with
cursing and swearing, as it were, saying: "I
know not the man."  One or two of the radical
papers made a bitter personal attack on him
because harmless German hair-dressers and
waiters were being interned while this wealthy
international financier, who <i>was</i> in a position
to collect information and influence opinion,
was left at large, thanks to highly-placed
friends and a title.  They said that some of the
Cabinet were absolutely dependent on him...
Though I saw nothing of the man, I could not
help hearing of him, for the mob broke his
windows in Westbourne Terrace whenever
there was an air-raid; they said he was shewing
lights to guide the Zeppelins to Paddington.
Whether there was a <i>word</i> of truth in it I can't
say...  And, when he erected an enormous
hospital at Rock Hill, even this was not
accounted to him for righteousness: the men
there held him to ransom, his own patients.
Some one would whisper that he had a secret
wireless apparatus on his roof; and immediately
Sir Adolf would build another ward or a
recreation-room or a picture theatre...
</p>

<p>
And in another sense they disappeared: as
Will said, "Plant an Erckmann in England,
and up comes an Erskine."  Poor souls, if they
had changed their names <i>before</i> the war and if
some one could have performed an operation to
rid Sir Adolphus of that appalling guttural
accent...  I really began to feel sorry for them
when all their friends&mdash;led, if you please, by
my Lady Maitland&mdash;turned the cold shoulder.
"Satisfy me," I said to Arthur, "that he is
a truly loyal subject, and I should like to see
if I could not shew him a little kindness."
</p>

<p>
"He's a noxious creature," said Arthur
with his usual intolerance, "but all these stories
of spying and of blackmailing ministers are
sheer flumdiddle.  It isn't worth his while.
Whoever wins, Erskine will make money.
He's technically loyal; but he's a man without
patriotism, because the whole world is his
country.  For the Lord's sake, don't throw
<i>your</i> mantle over him; as long as there <i>are</i>
national distinctions, I object to the way these
international Jew financiers settle in England
for their own convenience."
</p>

<p>
"I am not," I said, "concerned with that.
You may be right.  Perhaps we should all of
us have done better to hold aloof and offer him
no welcome at the outset.  But, do you know,
I feel a certain responsibility?  <i>Having</i> been
received here, having <i>poured</i> money like water
into the pockets of his so-called friends, will he
not form a low view of our sincerity and
goodwill if every one abandons him at a time like
this?  I am disinterested: we have accepted
nothing from him, we can look to him for
nothing; but there is a reproach which I feel it
my duty to remove."
</p>

<p>
I could not make Arthur see that people like
Connie Maitland, <i>liée</i> with the poor man one
moment and throwing him to the wolves the
next...  We are not <i>all</i> of us like that in
England.
</p>

<p>
"Well, for Heaven's sake, don't ask him
when <i>I'm</i> here," was the utmost encouragement
I got from my husband.
</p>

<p>
Truly honestly, I think this stubborn opposition
drove me perhaps farther than I had first
intended to go.  A day or two later I found
myself in the same house as Sir Adolphus and
I <i>spoke</i> to him...
</p>

<p>
"You," I said, "do not know me; and I
only know you by sight, though I have long
been acquainted with your record of generous
support to the cause of music.  Will you allow
a total stranger to tell you her disgust with the
venomous attacks which have been made on you
since the beginning of the war?"
</p>

<p>
Little enough, you may think; but I believe
those were the first kind words that he had
heard for three or four years.  The man is <i>not</i>
prepossessing, but we formed quite a friendship...
</p>

<p>
"Will not you and Lady Erskine," I said,
"come and dine with me some night?  I am
not in a position to <i>entertain</i> in any sense of
the word; my boy is at the front, my husband
is away on business; but perhaps, if a family
party would not bore you..."
</p>

<p>
Though I <i>called</i> myself a total stranger, he
knew very well who I was; indeed he told me
that he had always wanted to meet Brackenbury
and Spenworth (the Cheniston Romneys
were, of course, his excuse)...  We arranged
a night ... though, when the time came, there
was not more than the three of us.  My
relations with Spenworth are not so cordial that
I derive the least pleasure from seeing him at
my table; and one truly honestly <i>never</i> knows
how he is going to behave.  Brackenbury...
If you do not want to accept an invitation, it
is surely possible to decline it <i>civilly</i>...
</p>

<p>
"<i>That</i> fellow!," cried Brackenbury.  "He
ought to be interned."
</p>

<p>
"You really must not talk such nonsense,"
I said.  "He is as loyal as you are."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't touch him with a pole <i>before</i>
the war," said Brackenbury with his wonted
elegance.  "But <i>now</i>, when even his best
friends refuse to meet him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," I interrupted.  "You would
like him to feel that that is our standard of
sincerity and good-will."
</p>

<p>
"But how is it <i>your</i> concern?," he asked.
"You've kept clear of that gang in the past,
so why dirty your hands with it now?  If you
fancy you're going to get money out of him,
or a job for Will, I warn you that you're no
match for him.  He'll <i>use</i> you readily enough,
but he never does anything for anybody without
looking for a return.  We don't <i>want</i> these
gentry in England."
</p>

<p>
"I met him," I answered.  "I liked him,
I was <i>sorry</i> for him.  And, if I try to shew
him a little kindness, I really cannot allow you,
Brackenbury, to make yourself a ruler and a
judge.  Do I gather that you and Ruth would
prefer <i>not</i> to dine?"
</p>

<p>
"If it's money you want, I'd almost pay
you not to meet him.  <i>That's</i> how I feel about
it."
</p>

<p>
All this, you understand, about a man he
hardly knew by sight! ... I found it in my
heart to wish that Brackenbury <i>had</i> been
present when the Erskines dined.  <i>Nothing</i>
could have been more charming.  He talked
too wonderfully about music; I asked him a
little about himself, <i>he</i> asked me about
<i>my</i>self&mdash;that delightful first exchange when you are
laying the foundations of friendship.  Having
no children himself, he was of course most
anxious to hear about Will&mdash;what he had done
before the war, where he was in France at
present, what he proposed to do when the war
was over...  As <i>he</i> had introduced the subject,
I told him frankly that I found great difficulty
in making up my mind and should be truly
grateful if he would tell me, from his <i>very</i> wide
experience, what he considered most hopeful.
He promised to let me know; and, a few days
later, when I was dining with him, he asked
whether I expected Will home any time soon
on leave, as he always had a certain number
of openings in his own various businesses.  This
from the man who never did anything for anybody
unless he expected a rich return, the man
who <i>used</i> people but never allowed any one to
use <i>him</i>...  I had <i>asked</i> for nothing; in my
haste I had told Arthur that we could <i>look</i> to
him for nothing.  And if you knew; the long
agony of anxiety that I have endured...  I
may say, ever since we took Will away from
Eton.  I have seen my darling home in Mount
Street threatened...  The war was a god-send:
<i>some</i>thing to keep him occupied, a <i>little</i>
pocket-money; and, so long as he was not in danger,
I prayed for it to go on...
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sir Adolphus," I said, "the <i>first</i>
time he comes home you shall meet him."
</p>

<p>
That was in October.  Suddenly, lo and
behold! the armistice was upon us, and the
whole <i>world</i> was looking out for jobs.  I
laboured and <i>strove</i> to bring Will home; and,
the moment he arrived, I invited Sir Adolphus
to dine.  He telegraphed that he was at Rock
Hill, but could we not spend a few days with
him there?  My maid was out.  I began to pack
with trembling fingers...
</p>

<p>
Is it not curious that difficulties always seem
to come from the <i>least</i> expected quarter?  Here
was Will's whole future secured; he had woken
up, as it were, with a golden spoon in his
mouth.  My dear, I had the <i>utmost</i> difficulty
in persuading him to come at all.  What he
wanted was a holiday, he said; after all he had
gone through, he was entitled to a good time.
And, though he had never met the Erskines,
he had formed an unreasoning prejudice against
them which was incomprehensible in any one
of his breadth of mind...  I do assure you that
we reached a deadlock.
</p>

<p>
"Will," I said very firmly, "I <i>ask</i> you to
come."
</p>

<p>
"And I refuse point-blank," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"You will be sorry for it later," I warned
him, "when the opportunity has slipped beyond
recall."
</p>

<p>
"Something will turn up," he predicted.
Then, perhaps, he saw how his refusal was
paining me, for he added: "I've fixed up with
some fellows weeks ago that we'd all meet and
see life." ...
</p>

<p>
I had already begun a letter to Lady
Erskine, asking if we might postpone our visit
for a day or two, when Will came in&mdash;very
much upset&mdash;to say that his friends had broken
faith with him; one had already gone to the
country, the other two were busy presenting
letters of introduction and arranging interviews...
As if I had not known all along that,
the moment war was over, the whole world
would begin looking for jobs...
</p>

<p>
"<i>Now</i>," I said, "you can have no objection
to accepting the Erskines' invitation."
</p>

<p>
"Barring that I don't want to go," Will
rejoined.  "I draw the line at Jews at all times
and I don't in the least want to start work till
I've had a holiday."
</p>

<p>
"But others are already in the field," I
urged.  Lady Maitland shewed the sublime
assurance to reestablish communications and to
ask Sir Adolphus, in the name of their <i>old
friendship</i>, to find an opening for her second
boy!  "You can have all the holidays you want
later."
</p>

<p>
To my delight I saw Will weakening.
</p>

<p>
"What's the management like?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, everything is incredibly
perfect.  The house, the food, the music&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You may 'ave the music&mdash;fer me," said
Will.  (It was some allusion which I did not
understand.)  "Oh, all right!  I'll come.  But
I intend to have my fun out of it."
</p>

<p>
You have stayed at Rock Hill?  No?  Well,
I am not exaggerating when I use the word
"perfection."  A seventeenth-century Italian
palace with gardens that put Cheniston and my
brother-in-law Spenworth to <i>shame</i>; pictures
that one somehow always thought were in the
National Gallery...  And, if you care for
material comfort, as&mdash;I am not ashamed to
say&mdash;I <i>do</i>, not having enjoyed enough of it to
become <i>blasée</i>...  "If you cannot be rich
yourself, know plenty of rich people," as Will
said the first night...  In jest, of course...
</p>

<p>
If I wanted to make a criticism, I should
say that Lady Erskine might have chosen her
party on less catholic lines.  As patron of the
arts, Sir Adolphus is of course brought into
contact with an entire world of artists, musicians,
actors and the like which is outside my ken.
He confessed that he liked "mixing people
up" and trying to break down the very rigid
barriers which separate the artistic people from
the rest of us.  I have not the slightest
objection to that <i>on principle</i>, but, when it
necessitates meeting a number of half-naked young
actresses who truly honestly have no place in
the artistic or any other world...  And when
they are allowed to set the tone of the house...
</p>

<p>
I reminded myself that, with the exception
of Brackenbury Hall, I had not stayed in a
country-house for I don't know how long.
Nothing, I determined, should surprise me; in
Rome...  And so forth and so on.  We arrived
in time for dinner, and almost the first thing
I knew was that Sir Adolphus was pressing
upon me something which I think he called a
"Maiden's Sigh", which of course I imagined
was the well-known hock of that name.  <i>Why</i>
hock before dinner?  Sherry, if you like...
But I had determined that nothing should
surprise me.  I drank it&mdash;what it contained, I do
not know, but it was cold and, I suppose, very
strong, for it went <i>straight</i> to my head!  I
could drink <i>nothing</i> at dinner until I had
consumed an entire tumbler of cold water.  Indeed,
I hardly knew what I was saying, but Sir
Adolphus was talking so interestingly about
Rossini that I only wanted to listen...  Later,
when I had proved myself a good listener, it
would be my turn to talk about Will...
</p>

<p>
Now, you dine out very much more than I
do.  On those <i>rare</i> occasions when you meet
somebody who <i>can</i> talk, is it not heart-breaking
to have the conversation interrupted before you
have half finished it?  In the old days, when one
turned like an automaton to one's other-hand
neighbour half-way through dinner, it was
sufficiently exasperating; but one <i>did</i> hope that, if
one had not wearied one's companion too
unwarrantably, he would come up in the
drawing-room and resume what he had been saying.
Nowadays dinner is little more than a bribe
offered to so many women and men to induce
them to play bridge with <i>you</i> rather than with
some one <i>else</i>.  The tables were already set,
when we left the dining-room; Lady Erskine's
last words were: "You won't be long, will
you?"
</p>

<p>
I do not play.  Even in old days I never
mastered whist.  And I hope you will not cry
"Sour grapes", if I say that I do not <i>wish</i> to
learn.  I ask nothing better than a little music
after dinner.  If not too modern, it does not
interfere with conversation, whereas the sight
of a card-table freezes the most eloquent lips...
</p>

<p>
"What about a rubber before the others
come up?," asked one of these young actresses.
I had not caught her name and perhaps I am
doing her a grave injustice; but, if I had not
Lady Erskine's implied guarantee, I should have
considered her...  Well, let me say I should
have been <i>very</i> much surprised at being asked
to meet her...
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you must not count on me,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
The young woman reckoned up the numbers
present and asked:
</p>

<p>
"What about poker, then?"
</p>

<p>
Here, I am thankful to say, Lady Erskine
came to my rescue, and we contrived to exist
with nothing more exciting than conversation
until the men joined us.  Then, I think, something
must have been whispered to Sir Adolphus,
for he said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we'll have any cards to-night;
they're so unsociable."
</p>

<p>
Now, I wanted, above all things, to draw
Will and Sir Adolphus together and allow
them to become better acquainted.  And Sir
Adolphus, I knew, wished to talk to me, for
he had begun to ask at dinner whether I thought
it would interest Spenworth to see his pictures.
I therefore suggested that, if <i>I</i> might express
a wish, it would be for a little music.  Sir
Adolphus assented at once and asked one of
these rather ambiguous young women to play,
while I made room for him on the sofa and
beckoned to Will.  The Maitland boy&mdash;it was
<i>not</i> very tactful of the Erskines&mdash;had been
invited for the same week-end, but he was mooning
about like a lost soul, looking at the pictures
and talking to Lady Erskine...
</p>

<p>
"You asked me," I began, "to contrive a meeting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Won't you wait until this is over?," suggested
Sir Adolphus, with a nod towards the
piano.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind it," I said.  "Now, Will
has been away at the war since the beginning
of 1916..."  I won't weary <i>you</i>, but I gave
him a little account of my boy's work on the
staff, what were his tastes and ambitions
... and so on and so forth.  I really don't know
what this girl had begun to play, but she must
have changed suddenly, for the noise became
deafening...  "I really can't talk against
that," I protested.
</p>

<p>
Sir Adolphus went to the piano and
whispered something, but the noise only
increased.
</p>

<p>
"And she can't play against your talking,"
shouted Will.  "That's Elsie Creyne, in case
you don't know, and I'll bet she doesn't
much care about people talking when she's
playing.  I've been watching her to see what
would happen."
</p>

<p>
"Then I think, in ordinary kindness, you
might have warned me," I said.  "<i>I</i> have no
wish to hurt the young woman's feelings."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it might be rather a rag," was
all Will would say.  "I'm rather bored with
this place.  I kept going at dinner because
there was plenty of champagne; but, if
somebody doesn't do something, I shall have to
brighten things up by pulling old Herr von
Erckmann's leg.  He had the cheek to criticize
the staff at the end of dinner; I switched the
conversation on to repatriation of aliens, but I
haven't done with him yet."
</p>

<p>
It is this boyish irresponsibility that may
be Will's undoing!  <i>Mere</i> high spirits...
Before I could utter a word of warning, the
music had changed again, every one was dancing
and Will had jumped up to join them.  I looked
on&mdash;and marvelled; I had not seen any of these
modern dances.  And, when I could bear it no
longer, I turned my back and began reading a
paper...
</p>

<p>
That did in <i>time</i> have an effect; or perhaps
they merely tired of their revels.  But truly
honestly, if <i>I</i> had not made a protest, <i>no</i> one
would.  Nothing was said, but there was what
I can only call an atmosphere of guilt.  Then
Sir Adolphus discovered that dancing, too, was
"unsociable" and enquired whether there was
not something that we could <i>all</i> do...
</p>

<p>
Goodness me, are we so bankrupt in intelligence
that we need to be given childish games
to help us kill time?  Has conversation died
out in England?  And you will remember that
I was being invited to meet "artists" of every
shape and size, who are never so happy as when
they are sneering at the uncultured Philistines.
These "artists", apparently, unless you
encouraged them to dance or gave them rattles,
would have sat down and cried.  The
others&mdash;including, I am sorry to say, Will, who was
quite carried away by them&mdash;walked about saying
very loudly "What I want is a drink." ...
</p>

<p>
And I had not had a word alone with Sir Adolphus...
</p>

<p>
"What about Consequences?," asked some one.
</p>

<p>
We live and learn, as they say.  I have
discovered from my experience that week-end
that a certain class cannot make a suggestion
or ask a question without introducing it with
the words "What about." ... They put me
on my guard now; I feel, when I hear them,
that I know where I am...  But can you imagine
a greater confession of failure than to propose
such a game to fifteen or twenty grown men and
women, all&mdash;presumably&mdash;in possession of their
faculties?
</p>

<p>
"What about Characters?," asked some one
else.  "That knocks spots off Consequences."
</p>

<p>
I give you their <i>argot</i> in all its native
elegance.  You surely would not have me paint
the lily...
</p>

<p>
Before one had time to enquire or protest,
one had been set at a table and furnished with
a pencil while the rules were explained.  A list
of qualities, characteristics, whatever you like
to call them, was written down; a name was
chosen, and we had each of us to award marks.
Thus: you might choose the Prime Minister
and set out your qualities&mdash;statesmanship, force,
honesty, courage, eloquence, amiability, good
looks, personal charm and so on and so forth;
each of us had ten marks for each quality, and,
if you liked, you might give two for statesmanship
and four for eloquence and ten for courage;
then, when we had all expressed our opinion&mdash;it
was in secret, and no one saw what marks
any one else was allotting&mdash;the totals were
added and read out.  That was the man's
"character." ...
</p>

<p>
An absurd game!  But, as they were too
unintelligent to talk and too disobliging to
play or sing...  Will was writing down the
questions, and there seems no limit to the
number that may be asked.
</p>

<p>
"And what is to be the first name?" I enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it doesn't matter," he said.  "You
must take the whole lot in turn.  Begin with
me, if you like."
</p>

<p>
Then indeed I <i>had</i> to make a protest.  I had
never imagined that we were to play with the
names of the people actually in the room at
that moment!  More <i>execrable</i> taste...  I was
only thankful that Will had not proposed so
detestable a game and was sorry to see him
taking such a lead in it.  Personalities of all
kinds I abominate; there is a new school of
humour which fancies that it has been very
clever when people of better breeding would
only say that it had been unpardonably rude.
Spenworth?  Exactly!  You could not have
chosen a better example.  And games of this
kind always end in one way...
</p>

<p>
"Surely," I pleaded, "we need not run
the risk of hurting any one's feelings.  If
you take people who are known to us all by <i>reputation</i>..."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's much more fun this way," I was
assured by Will.  "And there's no need for
any one to be offended; all the questions are
about <i>good</i> qualities&mdash;charm and eloquence and
so forth.  If you think I have no charm, shove
down a nought; that's much better than having
'Bad temper' and being given ten marks for
it by everybody.  I'll start, anyway, to give you
all confidence."
</p>

<p>
I <i>ought</i> to have resisted more strongly, but
I could not let them feel that I was what Will
calls a "wet blanket" to everything they
proposed.  Already they had abandoned cards and
interrupted their dancing out of deference to
me...  We began to play, and I confess
that I found the game <i>mercilessly</i> tiresome.
Imagine!  A list of thirty or forty questions,
which you had to answer fourteen or fifteen
times over!  Then a pause, while the papers
were collected and the marks added; then the
totals and a great deal of discussion and laughter
and sometimes rather ill-natured facetiousness.
And then the whole thing over again!
</p>

<p>
It would have been wearisome enough if
they had played conscientiously; but, when the
game was treated as a joke or a means of being
malicious in secret, it was sheer waste of time.
When my turn came, I was let off with quite
a good character; but I am not vain enough to
attribute this to anything more than luck or
carelessness.  I was not one of the <i>intimates</i>;
they were in a hurry to put down any marks
anywhere and move on to their next victim.
At the same time I found it <i>exceedingly</i>
unpleasant when the totals were read out&mdash;or,
let me say, it <i>would</i> have been unpleasant if the
whole game had not been so ridiculous.  A
hundred and fifty marks was the maximum;
and, when "Love of Music" was given, I found
that I had been accorded&mdash;twenty!  I, who
had been clamouring for music when every one
else wanted to gamble or indulge in negro
dances...  And I have no doubt that I am
indebted for the <i>princely</i> total of twenty to
the chivalry of my host and hostess, who could
not very well criticize a guest&mdash;at least on that
score...  Will?  You think that Will came to
my support?  I do not know what had overtaken
him that night; his surroundings reacted
on him until he was unrecognizable.  When
we reached "Sense of Humour", he called
out:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, here's a lark!  'Sense of
Humour; grand total, nought.'"
</p>

<p>
All I can say is, I was glad to have enough
humour to see the absurdity and to join in the
general laugh.  But I was furious with Will...
</p>

<p>
You might have thought that, after I had
been pilloried and held up to the scorn of
young women whom I would not allow to enter
my back-door, artists or no artists, I might
have been suffered to go to bed.  But no!
That would upset the totals!  I must stay to
the bitter end, though my head was aching
with fatigue and I could see that the game was
growing more and more ill-natured...
</p>

<p>
I heaved a sigh when we reached Sir Adolf,
for his name completed the circle.  I don't
know whether the others were even trying to
give an honest opinion, but I did my best
according to my lights.  "Good looks"?  I really
think he would be the first to admit that he is
not prepossessing.  "Moral character"?  I'm
not a scandal-monger, I hope, but he <i>has</i> been
twice divorced.  "Loyalty"?  I gave him full
marks for that; otherwise I should not have
been staying in his house.  "Hospitality"?
He meant well, but a <i>guest</i> has <i>certain</i> moral
claims; I could only give him two for hospitality.
"Love of Music"?  Five for that, so far as I
remember.  "Sense of Humour"?  <i>Nought</i>!
I <i>couldn't</i> give him any marks for humour.
"Amiability"? ... But I cannot recall the
questions; there were nearly forty of them.
</p>

<p>
I sighed again when Will collected the
papers and added the totals.  Then came the
reading.  My dear, I had been led to suppose
that what we had written was all in secret, but
I <i>felt</i> that Sir Adolphus was guessing how we
had marked him.  "Good looks"?  He received
nothing for that, not a single mark from
the fifteen of us who were eating his food and
drinking his wine.  "Amiability"?  About
twenty, obviously given him by his wife and
the Maitland boy, who was <i>very</i> busy
ingratiating himself; or perhaps by one of those
ambiguous young women who seemed to be on
terms of such extraordinary <i>freedom</i> with him...
"Humour"?  Four or five.  "Honesty"?
Not more than fifteen or twenty.  It was too
terrible!  He tried to laugh it off; but, when
he got <i>no</i> marks, we were <i>all</i> exposed, and I
saw him glaring at one after another.  And
there was one question&mdash;"Personal Charm",
I think&mdash;when Will read out "<i>Minus ten</i>." ...
</p>

<p>
I <i>knew</i> it would happen.  There always is
some kind of unpleasantness when you begin
playing with personalities and taking risks with
other people's feelings.  I don't think I have
ever spent a more <i>distressing</i> quarter of an
hour.  Oh, I was thankful when he said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, so that's what you all think of
me, hein?  We-ell, what about a drink, what?"
</p>

<p>
I felt&mdash;we <i>all</i> felt&mdash;that he was really taking
it in very good part...  The men trooped off
to a side-table.  I made my way to Will in
the hope of whispering just a word...  He
<i>had</i> rather taken the lead in this ridiculous
game, and I wished him to be <i>extra</i> sweet to
the Erskines for the rest of our visit...
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>I</i> call it rather a frost," I heard
him say, as I drew near.  "I'd back
'Characters' to break up any house-party in
England, but everybody's taken it lying down
to-night..."
</p>

<p>
I was <i>distressed</i>, for I really thought we had
narrowly escaped some great unpleasantness.
And then I found that we had not escaped it
after all.  Sir Adolphus came up to see that
the others were looking after me properly and
asked if he might have back the pencil that he
had lent me.  I surrendered it, he looked at it,
pocketed it&mdash;and passed on.  The others
surrendered theirs, he looked at them...  Then
he came to Will...
</p>

<p>
"I was just wondering," I heard him say.
</p>

<p>
"Wondering what?," asked Will.
</p>

<p>
"Who gave me <i>minus</i> ten for&mdash;'Personal
Charm', wasn't it?  And nought for
'Loyalty', nought for 'Honesty', nought
even for 'Hospitality' ... Just wondering."
</p>

<p>
"It's a secret ballot," said Will.
</p>

<p>
"Some one gave me nought for everything
except 'Personal Charm', and there I received
<i>minus</i> ten...  I was wondering who it was."
</p>

<p>
"D'you suggest I did it?," asked Will.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I respect the secrecy of the ballot,"
answered Sir Adolf.  "But I noticed that you
were using an indelible-ink pencil and I was
clumsy enough to spill some soda-water over
some of the papers, including the only one
written with an indelible-ink pencil...  But it
is all a game, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
I have never felt so uncomfortable.  Sir
Adolphus said nothing more; he and Lady
Erskine were <i>too</i> sweet for the rest of the time
we were at Rock Hill.  But I felt&mdash;perhaps
quite wrongly&mdash;that I <i>could</i> not place myself
under an obligation to him, I could not <i>invite</i>
a rebuff...
</p>

<p>
Will was in no sense of the word to blame.
It was entirely my fault for not protesting more
vigorously against a game in which there would
inevitably be <i>some</i> unpleasantness, <i>some</i> one's
feelings hurt.  If we had been treated as
rational beings and allowed to talk...  Or
music.  I am easily satisfied, I ask for nothing
better than a little music...  If only the rising
generation were <i>rather</i> less self-conscious...

<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH REFUSES TO BECOME A MATCH-MAKER
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
If you will give me a moment to set my
thoughts in order, I think I can furnish the
whole story.  Indeed, if you are to skate in
safety this week-end at Brackenbury, it is well
to know where the ice will bear...  Goodness
me, I don't suggest for a moment that there
is anything to <i>conceal</i>&mdash;I can assure you I
should have had something to say before ever
receiving the girl or allowing my nephew
Culroyd to meet her&mdash;my boy Will can take care
of himself&mdash;; I meant that there is so little to
tell.  Surdan the name is; Hilda Surdan&mdash;and
no relation to our dear old admiral, nor to the
Lacey-Surdans, nor to that wild, eccentric tribe
of Surdans who have spread over so much of
Mayo...  If I may give you a hint, that is just
the sort of question that you have so particularly
to avoid.  I've no doubt that in a few
years they will have concocted a most convincing
pedigree, linking themselves to all and
sundry, but the idea has not occurred to them yet...
</p>

<p>
Homely, unspoiled people I thought them...
The mother <i>very</i> capable, but endearing...
Immensely rich&mdash;I believe it is shipping, but
the history books are silent...  Have you
observed a significant change in the biographies
of the present day?  We are always plunged
into the heart of things, as it were: "<i>called to
the bar in seventy-something, under-secretary
for this or that, entered the cabinet as secretary
for the other and, on retiring, was raised to
the peerage with the title of</i>"&mdash;something
<i>rather</i> far-fetched and pretentious, as a rule.
After that it's plain sailing.  But, if one
suggests that even a successful barrister must
have had some kind of father and mother, one
is considered to have been <i>tactless</i>...  I <i>believe</i>
it was shipping...  They talked a great deal
about "yards", which one always associates
with that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
I met Mrs. Surdan on one of my committees
during the war.  When my niece Phyllida was
working at that hospital, she befriended the
girl&mdash;Hilda&mdash;; and Mrs. Surdan made this an
excuse for introducing herself.  I recognized her
at once as one of the nameless, efficient women
who impose their wills on a committee; earnest
and hard-working, but occasionally rather
difficult, with their assurance and massed
information.  One feels that there is no subject on
which they will not put one right if one has
the temerity to open one's mouth.  Judge of
my surprise when Mrs. Surdan wrote that she
would like to come and ask my advice.  <i>My</i>
advice!
</p>

<p>
"This is your lucky day," said Will, when
I shewed him the letter.  "Perhaps they want
a house in London for the season."
</p>

<p>
Until that moment I had thought of telling
this Mrs. Surdan I was so busy that we must
really postpone our meeting.  Will's quick brain
warned me to do nothing hasty.  I don't know,
whether you <i>remember</i> the condition of Mount
Street; we had not touched the house, inside
or out, since the beginning of the war; and,
whenever I spoke to my husband, he put his
hands in his pockets and said: "Will you please
tell me where the money's coming from?"  I'm
not going to burden you with my own
sordid cares; but we are <i>not</i> well-off, and, what
with taxation and the rise in prices, Mount
Street is rather a responsibility.  I retain it
because it is my frame and setting; any little
<i>niche</i> that I may occupy is in Mount Street;
and, when I part with the house, you may feel
that I have indeed abdicated.  This morning
my tea was brought me on the tray that the
princess gave me as a wedding-present.  But
you know: the house is a museum of memories...
But it is a responsibility.  Arthur's directorships
are good so far as they go, but he says
there is a reaction against what he calls "figure-head
directors".  Will is not yet earning anything;
and I was cruelly disappointed by Sir
Adolphus Erskine when I approached him for
an appointment...  So our income is <i>not</i>
increasing, and the cost of living <i>is</i>...
</p>

<p>
I told Mrs. Surdan that I should be
delighted to see her at any time.  Arthur saw
at <i>once</i> the desirability of considering a good offer...
</p>

<p>
"She can have this place for the season,"
he said, "or for eternity.  <i>With</i> the plate and
linen.  <i>And</i> the servants.  And <i>Will</i>, if she'll
take him."
</p>

<p>
When Arthur speaks like that, I never
argue with him.  It is curious&mdash;one has seen
the same thing a thousand times between
mothers and daughters, but men always pride
themselves on being <i>un</i>petty&mdash;; Arthur is <i>really</i>
jealous of his own son.  If Will and he are
left together for any time, Arthur becomes a
different man, querulous, impossible to please.
With his directorships and his clubs and his
journeys to and fro, my husband&mdash;as you must
have seen&mdash;does not give me very much of his
society; I am left to support the burden of
domestic empire single-handed, but, when Will
is at home, I am <i>glad</i> for Arthur to be away.
When our boy applied for a commission, all that
Arthur would say was, why hadn't he applied
for it before?  When he joined the staff, why
hadn't he <i>refused</i> to join the staff?  When he
left it, why hadn't he <i>stayed</i> there?  <i>Picking</i>
a quarrel...  If only I could find him some
suitable employment!  But when a man like
Erskine or Erckmann or whatever his name
is...  A broken reed, a mere "climber" who
hoped to <i>use</i> me for securing an invitation to
Cheniston and the delectable friendship of my
brother-in-law Spenworth...  I have lost the thread...
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  For all its shabbiness, the dear
old house looked more than attractive when
Mrs. Surdan arrived for dinner.  Just the two
of us...  I always think tea is such an
inhospitable meal, and luncheon is hardly
practicable when every gleam of sunlight shews you
something more to be patched and painted...
As a matter of fact I might have spared my
pains, for she was not interested in the house.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Lady Ann," she said, with the
brisk, efficient manner which always rather puts
me on my guard.  "Let's come to business.  I
want your advice.  My husband has closed down
his department and is going north immediately.
I shall go with him, of course, and I want to
know what you would advise me to do with
Hilda.  After all the work she's done in hospital
I should like her to have a few months' complete
holiday and to enjoy herself, but obviously
I want to entrust her to some one who <i>will</i>
look after her.  Hilda is a thoroughly sensible
girl, but London is a big place, and I suppose
there is no harm in saying that she <i>is</i> very
attractive and will have a good deal of money
later on.  You know far better than I do the
importance of her meeting the <i>right</i> people.
What do you suggest?"
</p>

<p>
Now, do you know, I felt so certain what
she <i>wanted</i> me to suggest that it was on the
tip of my tongue to read her one of those
abominable advertisements in the morning
papers: "<i>A Lady of Title is willing to chaperon
a young girl; introductions...</i>" and so forth
and so on.  People putting any position they
may have up to <i>auction</i>!  Are you surprised that
London is <i>what</i> it is?  I have always wondered,
when I see the really and truly <i>inexplicable</i>
young women with whom Connie Maitland is
<i>liée</i> from time to time, whether <i>she</i> augments
her income in this way.  Otherwise I fail to
understand how she keeps on that great house
in Eaton Place and entertains as she does.  But
that is <i>her</i> business...  If Mrs. Surdan had
dared to propose such a thing, I really think I
should have asked her to leave the house...
</p>

<p>
"Surely," I said, "<i>you</i> are the best person
to look after Hilda.  I go out very little;
but, so far as I can judge, there is never
any difficulty about getting to know people
in London.  If you were to take a house in
some good neighbourhood and entertain a certain amount&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I should only be a handicap to Hilda," she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Do you know, I thought that <i>dear</i> of her...
It is the Lancashire "burr", is it not?  She
had that&mdash;not disagreeably, but it was there.
And her directness, never rounding the edge of
anything she said...  The girl, you will find,
has been polished without being made genteel.
If you catch them young, a good school
... or a governess whose ear has been trained to
detect and suppress those tell-tale oddities of
speech...  But you don't often find a mother
with the wisdom to recognize that and keep
herself out of sight...
</p>

<p>
"I don't know <i>what</i> to recommend," I
said.  "It would be no kindness to ask her to
stay here.  I am a dull old woman; there are
no girls to keep her company; and my husband
and I have long found that, in entertaining, it
is useless to compete with those who think in
pounds when we are forced to think in
pennies."
</p>

<p>
"I should like Hilda to enjoy herself," said
Mrs. Surdan.  "If some one entertained on
her behalf...  I should like her to be given a
ball, for instance...  But, of course, it wouldn't
be fair to ask <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be fair on Hilda," I said.
</p>

<p>
"May Hilda's parents not judge of that?,"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
A woman with a quite <i>conquering</i> smile...
I wish you had met her.
</p>

<p>
It was really like a struggle not to be first
through the door...
</p>

<p>
"If Hilda would <i>care</i> to come," I said at
length, "as my <i>guest</i>..."
</p>

<p>
"I can never thank you enough," said Mrs.
Surdan.  "She is very tractable.  Young, of
course...  And inexperienced about money..."
</p>

<p>
The best method of control, she thought,
would be for me to suggest a sum which would
cover all her expenses of every kind and for
her husband to pay that into my account...
"Hilda's pocket-money," we agreed to call
it...
</p>

<p>
It seemed an admirable arrangement, but
then Mrs. Surdan has the <i>practical</i> brain of a
man in some ways...
</p>

<p>
I took Arthur completely into my confidence...
</p>

<p>
Will...
</p>

<p>
I had great difficulty in deciding on the
right method of approach with Will.  State
the bald fact that the girl was coming&mdash;irrevocably
and without appeal; Will might have taken
a dislike to her and made my already difficult
task harder.  Make any mystery about it, and
she might have become the fruit of the one
forbidden tree, as it were, a sort of morbid
craving.  And that was the last thing I wanted...
In the end I told him frankly: she was
young, pretty and the only child of very rich
parents who wanted to launch her on "the
great world", as the literary people call it...
</p>

<p>
"And I expect you to help me," I told
Will.  "I don't <i>know</i> the young men of the
present day."
</p>

<p>
"I must have a look at her before I wish
her on to any of my friends," said Will, not
very encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
You know, there are some people who feel
they owe themselves a grumble...  As soon
as Hilda arrived, Will behaved charmingly.
You have seen her about in London, I expect?
Oh, well, she is <i>really</i> pretty: small, exquisitely
finished, with that "look-you-straight-in-the-eyes"
air which so many girls seem to have
acquired during the war.  I felt&mdash;<i>pace</i> her
mother&mdash;that she was thoroughly well able to
take care of herself.  Except, perhaps, in dress.
The first night she came down in a frock which
hardly reached her knees and seemed to stop
short at the waist&mdash;bare arms, bare shoulders,
bare back; I was quite shocked for a moment
when Will came into the drawing-room without
knocking...  However, so long as it did not
set him against her...  You see, I was simply
not equal to taking her out to daily luncheons,
dinners, plays, dances; inevitably a good deal
devolved on Will, but he was truly sweet about
it...  Seeing how <i>répandu</i> he is...
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I was in a difficult
position, for, while I never <i>dreamed</i> he would
look at her as a wife, I should have liked him
to establish some sort of claim on the girl's
father; and, if Will did not marry her, I was
not doing much to help the Surdan fortunes.
You know what men are!  So long as Will
was considered her natural protector, the others
kept away for fear of "poaching", as it were.
I felt it was a pity for them to be about together
so much.  I'm not ashamed to call myself
old-fashioned...  And these garish new restaurants
and poor Hilda's "uniform undress", as Will
rather wittily expressed it, made them very
conspicuous...
</p>

<p>
The girl felt it, too.  One day, when he'd
devoted half the night to looking after her at
a ball, she came to me&mdash;in real trouble, I
thought&mdash;, and we had a serious talk.  I told
her that, if <i>she</i> had not spoken, I <i>should</i> have;
Will was devoting himself to her so
good-naturedly that he was neglecting his own
prospects and doing nothing to secure an
appointment.
</p>

<p>
"As his mother," I said, "I cannot bear
to see his abilities wasting...  He needs a <i>good</i>
appointment; and I don't even know where to
<i>begin</i> looking for one.  But <i>you</i> are not to
bother your head about <i>my</i> affairs.  Tell me,
dear child, what is troubling <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
So far as I could make out&mdash;she spoke very
simply and nicely&mdash;, she was afraid of getting
into a false position with Will if she went about
with him so much.  <i>Affichée</i>...  At this ball&mdash;I
had handed on her mother's request that
we should be <i>most</i> careful whom we introduced&mdash;Will
had very unselfishly played cavalier the
whole evening; and, as she put on her cloak,
some girl had asked one of those silly,
impertinent questions which do such incalculable
harm...
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you must not distress yourself,"
I said.  "You know the old saying&mdash;'There is
safety in numbers'&mdash;; for the future..."
</p>

<p>
It was quite evident to me <i>now </i>that Will
did not intend to marry her.  He was furious
when I even <i>hinted</i> at such a thing...  And I
will tell <i>you</i> that I was glad.  She would not
have made a suitable wife, and no amount of
money will overcome those little hardly
perceptible angularities of breeding which make
the difference between a happy and an unhappy
marriage.  While there was any possibility of
such a thing, I <i>had</i> to hold my peace...
</p>

<p>
That night I improvized quite a big party
for her.  Will was not able to be present, as
he had a long-standing engagement to dine
with a man at his club.  We had encroached on
his time so much that for the first week of the
new <i>régime</i> I hardly saw him; he was simply
making up arrears with his other friends.  I
was lucky enough to get hold of Culroyd,
however; and, though he was hardly a substitute
for Will&mdash;I hate to say this about my own
nephew, but I always feel that my poor
sister-in-law Ruth imported a bucolic strain into the
blood&mdash;, he did his best and made quite an
impression on Hilda...
</p>

<p>
Indeed, I think you may say that it all
started from that night...  I <i>never</i> imagined
that Culroyd would fall a victim.  Hilda is
undeniably pretty and, of course, she is an
heiress; but, beyond that, she brings nothing.
Culroyd <i>is</i> heir to an earldom, and one would
have thought he might have done rather better...
It's not as if he <i>needed</i> money.  When my
brother Brackenbury sacrificed himself for the
good of the family, he did it on such a scale
that there was no need for any one to follow
in his footsteps for several generations.
Culroyd and Phyllida, for their age, are very well
provided for; and, of course, there is a great
deal more to come.  No!  I could not help
feeling that he must have inherited a taste for
money with his mother's blood.  It is
extraordinary how rich people seem to attract rich
people.  The Jews, for example...  And <i>vice
versa</i>.  I am sometimes so much afraid that
Will may throw himself away on some one
whom he'll simply have to support all his life.
And, short of selling the roof from over my
head and the clothes from off my back, I have
done all that I <i>can</i> do...  I have lost the
thread....
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  Culroyd!  I fancy I told you
that for a few months my niece Phyllida chose
to fancy that she had a grievance against me.
A young war-soldier tried to trap her into
marriage, glamoured no doubt by the title and
a fair presumption of money.  If I could feel
that I had done <i>anything</i> to check a most
imprudent alliance, I should be proud of the
achievement; I know, however, that I have no
right to throw myself bouquets.  The young
man did not acquit himself well under
cross-examination, and you may judge of this "life's
passion", as poor Phyllida would like to
consider it, by the fact that from that day to this
she has never heard from him.  The entire
family held <i>me</i> responsible!  Hitherto, I had
been on the best possible terms with my
relations&mdash;except, of course, my brother-in-law
Spenworth, and that is an honour which I would
sooner be spared&mdash;; now I was the universal
scapegoat.  Without yielding in <i>any</i> way to
cynicism, let me say that I was <i>amused</i>, after
my Lord Culroyd's first meeting with Hilda
Surdan, to find that he did me the honour to
make my house his own.
</p>

<p>
"Let me know some night when he and
Hilda are <i>not</i> dining here," said Will, when I
reproached him for always now deserting us for
his club.
</p>

<p>
For some reason there has never been any
great cordiality between the cousins.  Perhaps
Culroyd is a <i>little</i> bit consequential in the way
that he insists on his own dignity&mdash;a sort of
instinctive attitude of self-preservation, as
though he realized that he owes everything to
an accident of sex and that, if Brackenbury
and I changed places, he would have to change
places with Will...  And Will may very well
have been galled by the light-hearted way in
which Hilda could not get on without him one
day and got on quite comfortably without him
the next.  No one likes ingratitude, though it
was on the tip of my tongue to say that he need
not grudge his leavings to poor Culroyd.
</p>

<p>
It was not so easy to find a free night, as
the young people seemed to have made arrangements
for days ahead, and in the end I told
Will to leave them to their whispering and
silliness and talk to <i>me</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Why you ever invited her I don't know,"
he grumbled; and I could see that the strain of
playing cavalier for so long was telling on him.
</p>

<p>
"It was an opportunity for doing her a
little kindness," I said.
</p>

<p>
"And is she going to marry Culroyd?," he
asked, "or is she simply playing with him until
she finds something <i>better</i> worth her while?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it rather a question whether Culroyd
will marry <i>her</i>?," I suggested.  "After all,
she doesn't <i>bring</i> very much...  They seem to
get on quite well together."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't seen them," said Will.  "It
would be amusing to watch..."
</p>

<p>
When they all met, I can't say that it was
very amusing for <i>me</i>.  Will can be rather a
tease when he likes, but I think it a pity to
go on with that sort of thing if other people
haven't enough humour to take it in good part.
Culroyd and Hilda were so tremendously in
earnest that they couldn't bear to be chaffed;
and, the stiffer they became, the more irresistible
they were to Will.  I intervened once or
twice, when I thought Culroyd was losing his
temper, but the situation seemed to get suddenly
out of hand; there was something <i>very</i> like a
scene.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't know how to behave," said
Culroyd&mdash;very rudely, I thought, "do hire some
one to teach you.  Your manners would
disgrace a privates' canteen."
</p>

<p>
"Would they?  I'm afraid I'm not a good
judge," said Will.
</p>

<p>
It was neat; but, though I'm his mother,
I feel he ought not to have said it.  I expect
you know that Culroyd was still at Eton when
the war broke out.  Brackenbury positively
forbade him to take a commission before he was
eighteen, so Culroyd ran away and enlisted.  It
was in the regular army, you understand, and
they had every kind of difficulty in getting him
out.  He joined the Coldstream afterwards, but
for a time he <i>was</i> a private...
</p>

<p>
"A better judge of draft-dodgers, perhaps,"
said Culroyd.
</p>

<p>
The word was new to me, and I had to ask
for enlightenment.  When it came, I was <i>beside</i>
myself with anger.  The term is American
and applies to a man who "dodges" the
"draft", which is their word for conscription.
A wickeder or more reckless charge could not
be made.  Will applied for a commission within
the first year and a half of the war.  "You
can try," I said, "but I <i>don't</i> think the doctor
will pass you."  He did, however, and Will
served for three years with great distinction and
was quite invaluable to his general.  It was the
fashion at one time to sneer at the staff, but I
have yet to learn that war can be carried on
without one; and I sometimes wonder whether
the sneers were not mingled with a little <i>envy</i>
on the part of men who were not efficient
enough to be selected.
</p>

<p>
"Culroyd, you have no business to say that,"
I told him.
</p>

<p>
"Will doesn't deny it," he said.
</p>

<p>
And then I thought my boy shewed both
wit and dignity.
</p>

<p>
"If any one thought it worth while to call
me a homicidal maniac," he said, "I doubt if
I should bother to deny it."
</p>

<p>
"They'll never accuse you of even a tendency
to homicide&mdash;even in war," muttered
Culroyd, but he shewed that he had got the
worst of it.
</p>

<p>
I did not like to take Hilda upstairs and
leave them a chance of reopening the wrangle;
but, when I suggested that we should all go
up together, Will remembered that he had
promised to meet a man at his club.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Hilda very nicely, though
I felt that I really ought to apologize to her
for the little scene.  "I wanted to talk to you
and him privately...  There's no harm in
speaking before you, Lord Culroyd, because
you're one of the family.  My father wrote to
ask if I knew of any one suitable for a position
which is being created in one of his yards&mdash;rather
a good appointment.  He would like to give it
to a man who has been in the army, he says.
I have the letter upstairs and I remember that
the starting salary would be a thousand a year.
I think it is the Morecambe yards." ...
</p>

<p>
My dear! ... I said to myself, "Ann
Spenworth, you must keep your head."  For
a dozen reasons I wanted to get Will out of
London.  If Culroyd continued to <i>haunt</i> my
house, I was thankful to get Will out of the
way, though I cannot imagine that this ever
entered Hilda's little love-lorn head.  And an
<i>appointment</i>, when we had waited so long!
Besides, London is <i>not</i> good for Will's health.
He wakes up <i>with</i> a head-ache and <i>without</i> an
appetite&mdash;as a matter of course....
</p>

<p>
I telegraphed as soon as the office opened.
Mr. Surdan is a man of business, and the
appointment was settled before night.  Next day
I went up to help find the boy a comfortable
home.  Don't be shocked now!  I am simply
echoing Will when I say: "Morecambe is a
<i>God-forsaken</i> place."  <i>Rooms</i> were out of the
question, because he must have <i>some</i> one to look
after him.  I was recommended to a worthy old
clergyman, when everything else failed; and,
though Will protested beforehand, he resigned
himself when we reached the house.  Just the
father, the mother and two daughters, who
seemed quite fluttered on meeting Will and
hearing who he was.  <i>Quite</i> pretty girls in a
"left-to-run-wild" way...  Which I, personally,
did not mind.  After a month of dear
Hilda's nakedness it was a comfort to drop into
a world where you saw more clothes than <i>jeune
fille</i>...  Oh, I don't think Will runs any risk
from <i>them</i>; he <i>does</i> realize that love&mdash;in the
homely old phrase&mdash;doesn't pay the butcher's
book; and, after that, one has only to school
oneself not to fall in love carelessly.  But they
will give him pleasant, bright companionship
in the long evenings...
</p>

<p>
When I returned to London, Hilda was in
bed.  An internal chill...  She wouldn't see a
doctor, she said, as a few days' rest and warmth
were all that she needed.  <i>I</i> was not sorry to
have a few days' rest too.  First Will and then
Culroyd...  I found my little visitor a greater
strain than I had anticipated...  My "rest"
was "nothing to write home about", as Will
used to say, for I found myself required to cope
with a lioness which had been robbed of its
cub&mdash;Culroyd, I mean.  He came as usual expecting
to see Hilda&mdash;and pretending he <i>only</i> wanted
to see his poor old aunt!  <i>And</i> left the moment
he had swallowed his coffee!  It's a good thing
I'm not vain, isn't it?  Next day he came again...
At first it was habit, I think; he had got
into the way of meeting this child every day.
Then it became more serious.  If we are going
to bless this union, I think we must also bless
Hilda's influenza.  (It developed into that.
And a nice time I had!  Responsible to her
mother&mdash;and day after day the girl <i>refused</i> to
see a doctor.)  These boys and girls go about
together so freely that there is little inducement
to bring things to a head, as it were.  Goodness
me, when I first met Arthur, he would have
<i>liked</i> to go about with me everywhere, but my
dear mother put her foot down very firmly on
<i>that</i>.  And, when he found that it was almost
impossible for us to meet, Arthur suddenly
discovered that I meant more to him than he
had suspected...  So with Culroyd; history
repeating itself, so to say...  Hilda was a
<i>habit</i>; and, when the habit was broken by
influenza, she developed into a <i>need</i>.  Culroyd
had never taken much trouble before, but now
he called every afternoon with flowers and wrote
to her morning and evening.  She was quite
bewildered.  A very simple child...
</p>

<p>
When she was well enough to sit up on a
sofa, Culroyd fumed with impatience to see her.
He insisted on coming upstairs with me, though
I told him I wasn't at all sure...  And
so it proved: Hilda said she <i>really</i> wasn't
equal to meeting any one.  The next day she
was rather stronger, and I prevailed on her
just to let him bring the flowers into her
room.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Ann, will you leave us alone for one
moment?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Culroyd," I said....
</p>

<p>
Oh, I know it's done, but I was brought
up in a different school.  All this popping in
and out of young people's bedrooms...
</p>

<p>
"Please!  I <i>beg</i> you!," he said.
</p>

<p>
And then, before I knew where I was, he
had kissed me on both cheeks, tapped at the
door and disappeared...  I went to see about
some vases for the flowers; and, when I came
back, he was on his knees by the bed and Hilda
was stroking his head.  My old heart warmed...
I am not ashamed to confess it.  A radiance
that you see before young people have time to
become hard, worldly...
</p>

<p>
They announced it next day to Brackenbury,
though I am sure Hilda was imprudent to
travel.  Though I could not fairly be saddled
with any responsibility, I was a little nervous
to see how he would take it; every family has
its scapegoat, and at the Hall they have so
long found it convenient to dignify me with
that position...
</p>

<p>
"Were you surprised?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes," Brackenbury admitted.  "It
was commonly reported that you were keeping
Hilda up your sleeve for Will.  People told
me that it was impossible to walk into a
restaurant or theatre without meeting them.
You won't deny that you did rather throw them
at each other's heads?"
</p>

<p>
"Brackenbury," I said.  "If any one
thought it worth while to call me a homicidal
maniac, I doubt if I should bother to deny it...
But are you pleased?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," he said.  "They seem quite
happy; and that's all that matters."
</p>

<p>
And I preferred to leave it at that.  It is
not a great match.  Ruth, of course, is
delighted, because it supports her own conduct
in marrying Brackenbury....
</p>

<p>
Even Phyllida had a good word for me&mdash;which
was so gratifying!
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're all as pleased as we are,"
she said, with a funny, unsmiling expression.
Almost antagonistic...
</p>

<p>
I noticed that she had Hilda's trick of looking
you straight in the eyes&mdash;a sort of challenge
... quite fearless ... and ready to change in
a moment to impudence.
</p>

<p>
"I am," I said.  "Your uncle Arthur is away
and has not been told yet.  Will is away too."
</p>

<p>
"What's Will doing?," she asked.
</p>

<p>
"He was offered a post at Morecambe," I
told her.  "Hilda's father wanted some one
of experience and position, who was used to
handling men&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She seemed to find something to smile at in
that.
</p>

<p>
"What does he get?," she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
This absorption in pounds, shillings and
pence comes to them <i>entirely</i> from their poor
mother...
</p>

<p>
"A thousand a year&mdash;to start on," I told her.
</p>

<p>
"And cheap at the price," said Phyllida.
</p>

<p>
I had to beg her to enlighten me.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "I don't call a thousand
a year excessive to secure Will&mdash;in
Morecambe..."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Surdan was <i>naturally</i> pleased.  For
them, at least, it is a great match.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> little thought that it would end like
this, when you asked me to take charge of
Hilda for three months," I said.
</p>

<p>
And that reminded me that what they called
"Hilda's pocket-money" was lying almost
untouched at the bank in Arthur's name.  There
had been no ball, hardly anything...  But I
could not get Mrs. Surdan to say what should
be done with it...
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you didn't," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"So, if it's a failure, don't blame me," I
said.  "And, if it's a success, don't thank me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall always thank you for your kindness
to Hilda," she said, "especially when she was
ill."
</p>

<p>
"That was nothing," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Hilda's parents don't think so."
</p>

<p>
And then she did a difficult thing very
gracefully.  We must have the girl's room properly
disinfected, she told me; I assured her that
Arthur had already received an estimate for
redecorating the whole house.  Thanks to them,
we were now in a position...  Hilda's room,
she insisted, must be her province.  I have told
you that in the old committee days she
positively <i>imposed</i> her will on the rest of us; so
now.  She would not leave the house until she
had dragged the estimate out of me by main
force.
</p>

<p>
The work has recently been completed.
There was the usual letter to ask if we were
satisfied, and Arthur wrote out a cheque.  It
was returned.  Mr. Surdan had asked to have
the account sent to him...  I was <i>beside</i> myself
with anger at such a liberty...
</p>

<p>
I tell this against myself, because, having
gone to curse, I stayed to pray, as it were.
Mrs. Surdan wouldn't let me speak.
</p>

<p>
"Hilda is our only child, as Mr. Will is
yours," she said.  "If anything had happened
to her, you can imagine what we should have
thought.  Is it altogether kind to say that we
must not thank you for your devotion to our
little girl?"
</p>

<p>
There you have the woman&mdash;clever, direct,
going <i>straight</i> to my weak place...
</p>

<p>
What could one say?

VI
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH HOLDS THE <i>Corps
<br>
Diplomatique</i> TO ITS DUTY
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
I feel&mdash;don't you?&mdash;that, if the embassies can
give no enlightenment, they might just as well
not be there.  Paris is different, of course;
nowadays it is hardly more than a suburb of
London; with that vast cosmopolitan army
always coming and going, one is hardly expected
to be one's brother's keeper.  And Washington
is unlike any other capital; one goes there <i>en
poste</i>&mdash;or not at all.  But in Vienna or Rome...
Goodness me, in the old days when my
father was ambassador, it was a matter of course.
When a new star swam into your ken, you made
enquiries in the English colony; if not known
there or at the embassy, a wise woman stayed
her hand until she had a <i>little</i> something to
go on.
</p>

<p>
In London the <i>corps diplomatique</i> is more
<i>diplomatique</i> than <i>corps</i>.  Just a swarm of
warring atoms, some of them very <i>charming</i>,
all of them invaluable if a man fails you at
the last moment&mdash;a word by telephone to the
Chancery: "Two men; I <i>must</i> have them;
golf and bridge; the 4.20 from Waterloo; not
to bring a servant." ... And so on and so
forth.  Indispensable for entertaining on Connie
Maitland's lines.  They are so nice and tractable;
but worse than useless if you go officially,
as it were, for a whispered <i>word</i> of guidance.
As witness Mrs. Sawyer...
</p>

<p>
I cannot remember where I first met her;
probably at Lady Maitland's...  Sooner or
later one meets everybody there; and, with all
respect to dear Connie, I, personally, should
not mind if some of her protégés came a little
later and left a little sooner ... before I had
time to be involved, I mean.  It is all this
craze for collecting money and, incidentally,
carving a <i>niche</i> for oneself as the great organizer.
One pictures Connie standing blindfold over a
map of England and spearing it ruthlessly with
a knitting-needle.  "I, Constance Maitland,"
you can hear her saying, "ordain that <i>here</i> and
<i>here</i> and <i>here</i> I will erect hospitals, libraries
and wash-houses." ...
</p>

<p>
Whether the locality likes it or not, as it
were.  If the needle pierces Grasmere, so much
the worse for Grasmere.  It shall have its
hospital&mdash;in mid-lake, regardless of the <i>needless</i>
additional expense.  I <i>am</i> serious about that,
because I feel that, if Connie spent more
judiciously, she would not have to appeal so
persistently; some of us <i>did</i> contrive to keep
the machine running even before my Lady
Maitland descended upon us...  It does not
affect me much, because I am never able to
contribute more than a trifle; one cannot
undertake her new charities indiscriminately without
doing an injustice to the old.  Others are more
happily placed, and my only quarrel with
Connie is that I must either drop her or else
consent to embrace <i>all</i> her new friends.  This
Mrs. Sawyer, for instance...
</p>

<p>
I forget whether you were in London at
the time...  No, of course not.  Well, I can
testify to you that her arrival created quite a
stir.  The <i>rastaquouère</i> type is not unknown to
me by any means, but I thought Mrs. Sawyer
a very favourable specimen.  Not more than
two or three and twenty, though these South
American women reach their prime very early&mdash;and
pass it; jet-black hair and eyes, dead-white
face, scarlet lips, really beautiful teeth;
altogether a very striking young woman, with
just enough of a foreign accent to give an added
charm&mdash;for those who like that sort of thing.
She had a wistful, mysterious manner which
accorded well with the <i>ensemble</i> ... and with
the story they told about her.  I never heard her
maiden name, but I was told at once that she
was one of the greatest heiresses in Peru&mdash;or it
may have been Argentina.  This Sawyer was a
ne'er-do-well Irishman who had been sent to
South America ... as one <i>does</i> have to send
these people sometimes; he fascinated her,
married her, beat her (I should think) and
drank himself to death, leaving her utterly
broken-hearted and disillusionized&mdash;not with
<i>him</i> alone, but with the world...  She had come
to Europe to find a new life.  Such was the
story that Connie Maitland shouted at one; and,
if poor Mrs. Sawyer overheard it, so much the
worse for her...
</p>

<p>
A romantic setting, do you not agree?  If
you had seen her come into a room with those
great, tragic eyes sweeping face after face as
though she were looking for the <i>one</i> man who
would gather up the fragments of her broken
youth...  If I had been a <i>man</i>...  Superb
diamonds, I need <i>hardly</i> say; and almost an
arrogance of mourning, as though she would <i>not</i>
be comforted...  All the young men followed
her with their eyes&mdash;spell-bound.  And some
men no longer young...
</p>

<p>
Do you see much of that pathetic class of
over-ripe bachelor which my boy rather naughtily
calls the "Have-Beens"?  They are common,
I suppose, to every age and country, but
England seems to contain more than her fair
share.  Between thirty-five and fifty, not
particularly well-connected, not a <i>parti</i> among
them, not even extravagantly popular, but
useful&mdash;apparently&mdash;and <i>ubiquitous</i>.  I could give
you the names of a dozen...  Several of them
have been in quite good regiments at some time
or other.  I understand they belong to the usual
clubs; most of them dance quite competently;
<i>all</i> of them play extremely good bridge, I am
told...  Several women I know make out a
stop-gap list of them; then, if they're short of a
man&mdash;it is several grades lower than the
embassies, of course, and you are not expected
to give even a day's notice&mdash;, the butler can
telephone to them in turn until he finds one
disengaged.  Delightfully simple, is it not?
Having no personalities of their own, they
accord well with every one; having no pride,
they never resent an eleventh-hour invitation;
they are too discreet to pay unduly marked
attention to a married woman, they know their
place too well to attempt any intimacy with
the girls.
</p>

<p>
I am not ashamed to confess that I have an
old-fashioned prejudice in favour of a man who
is a man; but the kind I am describing seem to
ask nothing more of life than invitations and
more invitations&mdash;and this strange modern
privilege of being "Bunny" and "Chris" and
"Theo" to women who are old enough to have
outgrown such nonsense.  If you entertain&mdash;I
do not, as you are aware&mdash;, I believe it is
essential to have some such list as I have indicated;
and I am told that the men repay you by
running errands and being useful in a thousand
ways.  For <i>their</i> sake I hope they never hear
what other men say about them, even the
fellow-members of their little community&mdash;there is no
more contemptuous critic of "Bunny" than
"Theo"&mdash;or what the women say, for that
matter.  We may, if we are built that way, ask
"Bunny" or "Theo" to come and look at
frocks with us; but we don't respect the man
who does...  If any girl <i>dared</i> ask Will to waste
a morning, talking to her while she sat for her
portrait...
</p>

<p>
"Bunny" and "Theo" and "Chris" all
pricked up their ears when they heard about
Mrs. Sawyer.  It was another house for them to
lunch or dine at; and, of course, they were
expected to come to the old houses primed with
all the gossip they could pick up about her.  I
don't know whether any of them thought
<i>seriously</i> that they had a chance with her; they
must <i>surely</i> realize that a woman prefers a man
of some spirit...  And, if they do, they have
no excuse for standing in a ring and keeping
every one else away.  Of course, they were <i>useful</i>
to her.  Major Blanstock found her a house in
South Audley Street and helped her furnish it
and found servants for her and so forth and so
on.  He even introduced her to Connie Maitland&mdash;as
a short cut to knowing everybody, which I
gather was her ambition.
</p>

<p>
Certainly there is no one to equal Connie
for that.  You have seen men in the street,
unloading bricks from a cart and tossing them,
three or four at a time, from one to another?
Should Connie ever sustain a reverse, she will
always have a second string to her bow...  Major
Blanstock <i>tossed</i> this Mrs. Sawyer to Connie,
Connie <i>tossed</i> her to me...  I was expected, I
presume, to <i>toss</i> her on to some one else, but I
happen to have been brought up in a different
school; before I undertake the responsibility of
introducing a complete stranger, I like to know
<i>something</i> about her.  Goodness me, I don't
suggest that my recommendation counts for
anything, but for my own peace of mind, when
somebody says "Oh, I met her at Lady Ann's"&mdash;there
<i>is</i> an implied guarantee&mdash;, I want to
feel that my friends' confidence is not misplaced.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Major Blanstock," I said, "I want
you to tell me <i>all</i> about your lovely young
divinity, the rich widow.  If I am to befriend
her, I must know a <i>little</i> about her."
</p>

<p>
I imagine that I was not the first enquirer,
for he answered with an impatience which in
other days some of us might have considered
uncivil.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Is</i> she rich?," he asked.  "I know nothing
about her.  I don't even know she's a widow.
I met her on the boat coming home from Buenos
Aires; and, as she'd never been in London, I
tried to make her feel at home and asked Lady
Maitland to give her a helping hand."
</p>

<p>
And that was literally all I got out of him&mdash;the
fountain-head.  <i>Connie</i> knew nothing and
wanted to know nothing.  It was enough that
Mrs. Sawyer was presentable in herself and
would attach her name to <i>any</i> subscription-list
for <i>any</i> amount.  The others&mdash;people who are
usually well-informed&mdash;simply handed on the
gossip which they had themselves made up
overnight.  It was then that I approached my
diplomatic friends.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty was to know where to start.
I couldn't commit myself, I felt, by <i>one</i> dinner,
so when my Will came back...  From the
north, yes.  You knew that he was home?  Oh,
yes!  Well, at the moment he is not doing
anything.  The Morecambe experiment was <i>not</i>
a success; the place didn't suit him, and he
didn't suit the place.  That is all I care to say
on the subject.  Half-truths are always
misleading; and I cannot tell you the full story,
because I do not know it.  Should it not be
enough to know that for days my spirit was
<i>crucified</i>?  And the end is not yet...  I
have lost the thread...  Ah, yes.  We dined
<i>à trois</i>: Will and Mrs. Sawyer and I.  She
was fascinating, magnetic.  For the first time
Will forgot all about the odious clergyman's
odious daughter...  No, it slipped out.  That
belongs to the unhappy Morecambe episode,
and I really do not think it very kind of you to
keep trying to pump me when I have said I
prefer not to discuss it...  When he returned
after seeing her home, Will wanted to know all
about her, and in such a <i>way</i>...  I mean, if
his voice and manner meant anything, they
meant that he had met his fate, as it were.  I
could tell him little.  For one thing, I didn't
know; for another, his excitement had gone to
my head, I saw ten things at once and, breaking
through them all, this splendid, untamed creature
with the flashing eyes walking side by side
with my Will.  Such a contrast ... and <i>such</i>
a combination...
</p>

<p>
"Well, hadn't you better find out something
about her?," said Will.
</p>

<p>
I promised to do my best, but one was sent
from pillar to post in a quite too ridiculous way.
I <i>thought</i> some one had told me she came from
Buenos Aires (perhaps it was only Major
Blanstock's saying he had met her on the boat
coming home from there); I tried the Argentine
colony and the Legation, only to be
referred to the Brazilian Embassy; and there,
though I am <i>sure</i> they had never heard of her,
they were certain that she came from Peru.
Until then, I had never realized how many
republics there were in South America; I went
from Colombia to the Argentine and from
Ecuador to Chili.  <i>Invariably</i> the first question
was: "<i>What</i> was her name before she <i>became</i>
Mrs. Sawyer?"  And that, of course, I did
not know.
</p>

<p>
There is such a thing as <i>trop de zèle</i>,
sometimes hardly distinguishable from making
oneself ridiculous...
</p>

<p>
"Surely," I said to Will, "our judgement
of this person or that is a better criterion than
the bald (and perhaps inaccurate) statement
that a person was <i>born</i> here and <i>married</i> there.
Connie Maitland has asked us to shew some
little kindness to our friend; and I am not
ashamed to confess that it seems <i>grudging</i> to
insist too much on credentials.  In a favourite
phrase of your own, Will, she is "good
enough" for me; and, if any one says: "I met
her at Lady Ann's," I should be tempted to
answer: "I hope you do not need a better
recommendation."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to look a fool, that's all,"
said Will.
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," I reassured him, "if she
were a complete impostor, does one make a fool
of oneself by asking her to dinner once or
twice?  If so, I am afraid I rank hospitality
above my own personal dignity."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, it was all the other
way.  Mrs. Sawyer developed a mania for
entertaining.  I went gingerly at first, for one
had seen so many <i>rastaquouères</i> treading that
road, but no fault could be found with her
methods.  Either through Connie Maitland or
others, she seemed to know <i>every one</i>, and you
went to the little <i>réunions</i> in South Audley
Street with the certainty that, if you did not
meet all your friends there, at least every one
that you met would be a friend.  I enjoyed her
parties; indeed, I only hope that she enjoyed
them as much as we did, though I confess I
sometimes looked at those tragic black eyes and
wondered what amusement it could give her.
</p>

<p>
Stay!  There was <i>one</i> blot: her hospitality
left one no opportunity of making an adequate
return.  Where there is a marked difference of
means, I am the last to suggest that one should
proceed on the principle of "a cutlet for a
cutlet and a quail for a quail", but it is
uncomfortable to feel that everything is coming
from one side.  My <i>own</i> conscience is clear, for
we had done our part; Mrs. Sawyer had in
fact dined with us once in Mount Street&mdash;just
Will and me; I am not in a position to
entertain in the old sense of the word&mdash;, we had
asked her again at least once, and she had never
been able to come.  It was always: "Oh,
won't <i>you</i> come to <i>me</i>?  And whom shall I ask
to meet you?  And would you prefer just to
dine or shall we go to a play?"  All in that
charming almost-broken English of hers.  It
would have been ungracious to refuse...
</p>

<p>
I confess that I never saw and do not see
to this day how some of the "Have-Beens"
justified their existence.  I mean, Will and I
dined or lunched or went to a play with her
three and four times a week, <i>simply</i> because
Major Blanstock told us that she was alone in
London and Connie Maitland had asked me to
look after her.  I can assure you, we <i>never</i>
went to South Audley Street without finding a
little cluster of "Bunnies" and "Theos" and
the rest.
</p>

<p>
I tackled one of them about it...  This is
between ourselves, but it was Mr. Gorleigh&mdash;"Reggie"
Gorleigh, I suppose I should call
him, to be in the fashion.
</p>

<p>
"You seem a <i>great</i> friend of Mrs. Sawyer,"
I said.  "I am always meeting you here.  Tell
me; I don't know how long she is staying in
London, but one would like her to take away
a pleasant memory of such hospitality as one
can shew her.  Is there anything we can do to
make a little return?  I hardly like to go <i>on</i>
taking with both hands."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I felt that from the first," said
Mr. Gorleigh.  "Geordie Blanstock introduced me,
and I came here once or twice...  Then I felt
... as you do; and I cried off.  The only
thing is, she <i>hasn't</i> many friends, and I thought
it wasn't quite fair, perhaps, to stay away out
of a sort of false delicacy.  The poor little
woman <i>wants</i> companionship."
</p>

<p>
"Your feelings do you credit," I said as
gravely as I could.
</p>

<p>
Really, it would have been laughable if it
had not been so disgusting.  A man who lives
by sponging on his friends for free meals to
pretend that he was coming, against his will, to
give "the poor little woman" the inestimable
privilege of feeding him...  But, if you please,
that was the accepted "eye-wash", as my boy
would call it.  In a spirit of pure mischief, I
am afraid, I went from one to another: "Bat"
Shenstone, "Laurie" Forman, "Theo" Standish,
"Bunny" Fancroft.  Always the same
story!  <i>They</i> didn't come to the house for what
they could get out of it; I must understand
that they were Mrs. Sawyer's <i>friends</i>.
Hoity-toity!  Friends with a capital "F"...
</p>

<p>
Very soon it was "Consuelo's" friends.
Looking back on it all, one seems to hear a
series of commands: "on the word 'loot',
quick march; on reaching South Audley Street,
halt and enter; on the word 'love' ..." and
so forth and so on.  No, it's not mine; Will
drew a most amusing picture...  But that is
literally what happened: first of all, they were
"Consuelo's" <i>friends</i>, then they were all in
love with her.
</p>

<p>
I have suggested that men of that stamp
are incapable of being serious about
anything&mdash;except the next meal; but any one who was
genuinely fond of the poor woman could not
help seeing that this formal persecution was
more than a joke.  Will came to me after one
of her parties and said that it was high time
for us to <i>do</i> something.
</p>

<p>
"Get her <i>away</i> from all that gang," he
cried; and from the agitation of his voice I
could see that he was taking this to heart.
</p>

<p>
And, you know, it was rather dreadful to
see that lovely creature with the tragic eyes
standing like a bewildered child with all these
young-old men baying round her...
</p>

<p>
"It's easier said than done," I told him.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom Brackenbury's going north
for the Twelfth," said Will.  "Get him to
lend you the Hall and ask Consuelo down."
</p>

<p>
My brother, as you know, is of so curious
a temper that I have always been more than
chary of even seeming to put myself under an
obligation to him.  One had the feeling, don't
you know, that, if <i>he</i> did not place a wrong
construction on one's request, my niece Phyllida
<i>would</i>...  Since Culroyd's engagement,
however, poor Aunt Ann's shoulders have been
relieved a little of their burden; the family
persists in thinking that I contributed to bring
it about, whereas I rigidly set my face against
any planning of that kind and was only responsible
to the extent that Hilda Surdan was staying
in my house when my nephew Culroyd met
her...  The point of importance, however, is
that Aunt Ann is now embarrassingly popular.
Brackenbury lent me the house almost before
I asked for it...
</p>

<p>
Then I had to think how the invitation
might be made most attractive to Consuelo.
After the <i>excitement</i> of her life in London,
undoubtedly the best thing would have been to
give her all the rest and quiet that we could.
There is, however, a strain of something restless
and untamed about her; one pictures her
running bare-foot through the woods or plunging
into the surf by moonlight; and, though she
would overcome that in time, I could not conceal
from myself that, on the one occasion when she
had dined with us <i>en famille</i>, she had flagged...
I told her that I hoped to secure some of our
common friends; and Will and I worked hard
to arrange relays of the people who would best
accord, so to say...
</p>

<p>
I started with Major Blanstock, as he seemed
her oldest friend.  To do him justice, after the
first meeting at Connie Maitland's house, I had
never seen him with the jackals; he didn't
pretend to be in love with her, he didn't talk about
the pearls of his friendship and he didn't even
refer to her as "Consuelo".
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted to come, if I can get
away," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Your fascinating young widow is coming,"
I said, as a bait&mdash;though I felt that he had long
ago lost interest in her.
</p>

<p>
"<i>My</i> widow?," he repeated.  "I am alive&mdash;and
unmarried, Lady Ann."
</p>

<p>
"Silly man!  Our Brazilian heiress," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Mrs. Sawyer," he said.  "Is she
Brazilian?  I didn't know that.  But it's not
fair to embarrass her with my friendship.  She
is almost a stranger to me; I don't know that
she's an heiress, I don't even know that she's
a widow."
</p>

<p>
"But," I said, "surely her husband drank
himself to death."
</p>

<p>
"Some one told me that he <i>drank</i>," said
Major Blanstock.  "Whether he drank himself
to death I can't tell you.  I didn't feel it was
my affair..."
</p>

<p>
I forget whether any one was with us at
the time, but this story spread...  At least, it
wasn't a <i>story</i>; several people, knowing nothing
of the facts, had chosen to assume that a
certain woman was a widow; one man, equally
knowing nothing, said that he did not know
whether she was a widow or not.  Goodness me!
Did it matter two pins one way or the other,
so far as we were concerned?  I should have
been sorry to find out afterwards that there
had been any kind of scandal, because one had
thrown one's mantle over the woman and given
an implied guarantee, as it were.  That was why
I <i>did</i> attempt to learn a little something from
my diplomatic friends...  But it is hardly too
much to say that a panic ensued among the
"Bunnies" and "Theos".
</p>

<p>
"They tell me," said Mr. "Bat" Shenstone,
"that Mrs. Sawyer's husband is still
living."
</p>

<p>
"Oh?," I said.  That phrase&mdash;"They tell
me"&mdash;!  It always puts me on my guard.
</p>

<p>
I nearly told <i>him</i> that, if he was only a <i>friend</i>
to her, it did not matter whether she had a
husband or not...  I noticed that she was
"Mrs. Sawyer" now...
</p>

<p>
The stories that I met for the next few days
were so fantastic that I really think some one
must have been deliberately making them up.
At one moment the husband was in a home for
inebriates, at another he was alive and well with
a formidable revolver ready for any one who
became too "friendly" with his wife; at another
he was supposed to be in prison for actually
shooting a man; then she was said to have
divorced him, then he was said to have divorced
her.  Finally I was assured that she had never
had a husband and was an adventuress who had
come to exploit London.  The money, I was
told, was a decoy, and in reality there was no
money; she had been left a few thousands by
some man with whom she had been living; and
she was pouring it out right and left in the
hope of ensnaring some one else before it was
all spent.
</p>

<p>
I really did not know what I should be
required to believe next.
</p>

<p>
"We must clear this up," said Will one
night when we were all down at the Hall.
</p>

<p>
"Which story in particular?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"All of them," he answered very decisively;
and at once.  I'm not thinking of <i>us</i>, but we
can't afford to let Consuelo have these lies
circulating about her.  Why don't you talk to her
and find out the truth?"
</p>

<p>
I am not ashamed to confess that I rather
shrank from the prospect.  Mrs. Sawyer had
always been so singularly uncommunicative that
it seemed impertinence to peer behind the veil.
And the more so when she was one's guest.
I don't think I could have screwed up courage,
if Will's forethought had not shewn me the
way; but I <i>did</i> tell her as gently and sweetly as
I could that there was always a certain idle
curiosity about foreigners who came to live in
England and that, in her case, the curiosity was
increased by her beauty and immediate success.
I coaxed her to tell me a little about her life...
</p>

<p>
"What do you want to know?," she asked.
</p>

<p>
Those great black eyes&mdash;-how I wish you
had seen her!&mdash;became cold as stone.  I was
<i>frightened</i>...
</p>

<p>
"Your husband..." I began.
</p>

<p>
"He is dead."
</p>

<p>
Truly honestly, do you know, I couldn't
go on.  I <i>did</i> find out that he had been dead
eighteen months and they had been married for
less than a year and there were no children.
That, at least, was her story; one had no
opportunity of testing it or catching her out
... even if one had wanted to.  <i>Who</i> she was
before, <i>where</i> the money came from, <i>if</i> there
was any money&mdash;not a word!  To this day I
don't know whether she hailed from Paraguay
or Venezuela...
</p>

<p>
"She is a widow," I was able to tell Will;
and indeed I took great pains to scotch these
ridiculous stories which had been swirling round
London when I left.  It was cruel that any one
should say such things of <i>any</i> woman; and, if
my boy ever thought fit to drop the handkerchief,
I did not want to have any explaining-away
to do.  She was greatly attracted to him,
and I fancy that the one doubt in his mind was
the immense difference in blood and breeding:
Roman Catholic (I presume; I have no certain
knowledge even of that) and Anglican, Latin
and Anglo-Saxon ... and so forth and so on.
We really knew so very little about her that my
boy prudently and properly did not seek to
press his advantage with her prematurely...
</p>

<p>
I sometimes feel that in London one uproots
one lie only to make room for another.  A few
days' "propaganda", as Will would say,
convinced people that "the mystery woman", as
some one christened her, had no homicidal
husband lurking with a revolver behind the nearest
bush.  But a different story became wide-spread
... indeed, universally repeated and almost
universally believed.  The old story, I should
say, was revived.  People said that she had
come over with a few thousands and had spent
every penny of it.
</p>

<p>
"I have no more knowledge than you have,"
said Major Blanstock, when I tackled him about
it one day at Brackenbury; and then he added
with rather a tiresome assumption of virtue:
"I didn't feel it was my affair."
</p>

<p>
"But you're her friend," I said.
</p>

<p>
"If she gives me an opportunity of proving it."
</p>

<p>
"And in some ways her sponsor," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I would stand sponsor for her at all
times," he answered.  "If your story is true,
she will have an opportunity of proving the
quality of all her friends."
</p>

<p>
And there the thing ended, so far as we were
concerned.  Brackenbury had lent us the house
for two months; but, when Consuelo left us after
a fortnight, we were not sorry to return the
following day to London.  I was in terror that
Will might commit himself before we had really
found out anything; but, the moment these
stories began circulating again, he very wisely
retired into his shell; I suppose it was because
she felt that no progress was being made that
Consuelo curtailed her visit.  Or, perhaps, with
that restlessness of hers, she was simply bored;
<i>my</i> feelings would not suffer if she told me that
one dull old woman...  I should explain that
our scheme of house-parties broke down; the
women, indeed, came, but man after man failed
us at the last moment.  One spent Friday
morning despatching one's staff in turn to the
telephone with names and more names and yet <i>more</i>
names...
</p>

<p>
I found it hard to believe that <i>all</i> the
"Bunnies" and "Theos" were in such request,
but no enlightenment was vouchsafed until our
return to Mount Street.  If there had been a
panic when we left London, the phrase <i>sauve-qui-peut</i>
is hardly too strong for the condition
we found awaiting us.  Some one had industriously
spread this story that Mrs. Sawyer was
a mere adventuress, and everybody was anxiously
disclaiming all acquaintance with her.  I have
suggested that for months it was impossible to
enter South Audley Street without running into
Mr. "Reggie" Gorleigh; with my own ears I
heard him say: "Mrs. Sawyer?  Oh, that South
American woman!  I <i>think</i> I know who you
mean."
</p>

<p>
For sheer audacity...
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what else you would expect,"
said Major Blanstock one day.  "People in
London will take anything from anybody&mdash;and
go on taking it so long as they think there's
money about.  If you whisper that they may
afterwards have to make a return, they vanish
into thin air.  I know nothing of Mrs. Sawyer's
affairs; but, if it's true that she <i>has</i> lost all her
money, I should have thought that her friends
would have rallied round her and shewn that it
made no difference.  On a strict calculation of
one meal against another, they could keep her
from starving for a year or two."
</p>

<p>
"And so I have no doubt they will," I said,
though I detest all this modern weighing and
balancing.
</p>

<p>
Where calculation comes in, hospitality goes
out.
</p>

<p>
"She's absolutely deserted!," he cried.  "I
know, because I'm the only man who goes near
her."
</p>

<p>
"That, Major Blanstock," I said rather
sharply, "is neither fair nor true.  Consuelo
spent a fortnight with <i>us</i>, she was invited to
stay longer."
</p>

<p>
"But would you ask her again?," he
sneered; and I could see that he was most
offensively hinting that we, like the rest, had
dropped her when the bubble was pricked.
</p>

<p>
"My brother has unfortunately resumed
possession of Brackenbury," I told him.
</p>

<p>
And then I really had to pretend that there
was somebody at the other end of the room who
wanted to speak to me...  I hope I am tolerably
good-tempered, but I will not allow every one
to make himself a ruler and a judge...
</p>

<p>
All through the summer it had been "Mrs. Sawyer
this" and "Mrs. Sawyer that".  <i>Dear</i>
Consuelo was so charming, her parties were so
delightful.  If one did not know her, one must
take steps to become acquainted.  And so forth
and so on...  In the autumn there was what I
can only describe as a <i>guilty silence</i>; it was in
questionable taste to mention her; she dropped
out completely, and one almost begged one's
man <i>not</i> to bring the car home by way of South
Audley Street.  Every one seemed to fear that
she might present herself any day at the door
and claim to be taken in and supported by those
who had only accepted her too lavish hospitality
because they were "friends" and a little sorry
for her lonely state.  Then came the great
surprise...
</p>

<p>
It can only have been a surprise to people who
had <i>jumped</i> to conclusions without troubling to
collect a <i>shred</i> of evidence...  I purposely kept
my mind a blank...  There were rumours; and
then one read the announcement&mdash;that she was
marrying this Major Blanstock.  I believe she
is a great heiress, I believe her husband <i>did</i>
drink himself to death.  And I still believe, as
I always believed, that she is a thoroughly nice,
very unhappy woman...
</p>

<p>
She would never have done for Will...  As
you would be the first to agree, if you had seen
her.  Oh, I can't describe my relief that nothing
came of <i>that</i>.  The difference of blood and
breeding&mdash;Roman Catholic and Anglican, Latin and
Anglo-Saxon...
</p>

<p>
But I feel that the poor woman would have
been given a fairer chance if her own people at
the Legation had been able to tell us something
about her.  If they can't do that, I really don't
know what they are there for or why one takes
the trouble to invite them to one's house...

VII
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH DEPLORES PROPOSALS BY WOMEN
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
Oh, but I fully believe they do it!  There were
rumours even before the war.  To my mind, the
idea that <i>any</i> girl should ask a man to marry her
is <i>so</i> repugnant that I can hardly think of it
calmly.  All so-called "Leap-Year jokes" seem
to me to be in execrable taste...  <i>Since</i> the war,
with these millions of superfluous women, I am
told that it has become quite common.  You
have always had the cranks who claimed that a
woman had as much right to choose a husband
as a husband to choose a wife; and now girls
like my niece Phyllida say that, with the general
upset of war, a little money frightens a man
away and, if you want him to see that a difference
of means is not a real obstacle, you have
to take the first step.  I'm inclined to say:
"Rubbish, child, rubbish"&mdash;and <i>again</i> "Rubbish".
Since when have young men developed
these fantastic scruples?  And does any girl
think that the only way of securing a man is
to propose to him?  I should have <i>imagined</i>...
But I was brought up in a different school...
</p>

<p>
Phyllida, of course, was struggling with her
obsession.  I do feel Brackenbury incurred a
responsibility in not sending her <i>right</i> away.
Ever since Colonel Butler disappeared, she has
alternately fumed and fretted.  Now she is
becoming hard and cynical; if she were ten years
older, you would call her "soured".  Ridiculous
at one-and-twenty, or whatever she is...  And
she became no more normal after giving up
hope of him.  Oh, yes, I'm thankful to say
that I think all that is <i>quite</i> over, though we
must expect to see an occasional relapse; hence
the discussion.  She said that, if she met her
Hilary or ever found out where he was, she
would throw herself into his arms and ask him
to marry her.  And <i>sotto voce</i> the customary
hateful suggestion that I had taunted him with
wanting to marry her for her money and so
driven him away in order to clear the ground
for my Will.  It is always on the tip of my
tongue to say that she seems very certain of my
boy.  But it is the modern fashion for a girl to
think she has only to drop the handkerchief...
Brackenbury patted her hand (if he had slapped
her it would have been more to the point), I
went on with my work.  She wanted the stimulus
of a little opposition, and that was just what I
refused to give her.  Then she began talking in
general terms about the difficulty that a girl has
in finding a husband nowadays: fewer men than
ever, all of them uprooted by the war and
uncertain of their future, widows marrying again,
the older women remaining young so much
longer.  I felt that, to some extent, it was all
true, but I was surprised to hear such truths
on Phyllida's lips if she still wanted me to think
she was faithful to Colonel Butler's memory...
</p>

<p>
Culroyd's marriage made a difference, of
course.  He was a devoted brother, according to
his lights; and I think she is missing him greatly.
And one wedding, like one funeral, leads to
another.  <i>You</i> have seen it again and again!
The <i>trousseau</i>, the presents, the letters, the
general excitement, the very contagion of two
young lovers...  All this coming at a time when
she seemed <i>deliberately</i> to be making herself as
unhappy as possible...  I knew there would be
a strong reaction, I was only afraid that she
might throw herself at my Will's head and that
he might be unable to say "no".  I kept him
away from the Hall as much as I could.  If he
<i>really</i> wanted her, he could drop the
handkerchief&mdash;I felt&mdash;in his own good time...
</p>

<p>
"Your turn will come," I told her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't care who I marry," she
answered.  "I suppose I shall need a home when
I'm turned out of here; and, if so, I'd better
get to work while I'm still young enough to
attract men.  I'm open to any offer; the man
mustn't be <i>too</i> hopeless a cad, that's all."
</p>

<p>
This mock-desperation would have been very
cynical if it had not been so unconvincing.  I
said nothing at the time; but, when I had a
moment alone with her poor mother, I <i>did</i> feel
it my duty to say candidly that it was time
<i>some</i>body did <i>some</i>thing to change the girl's
thoughts.  Ruth agreed, but in a helpless,
hopeless way that always makes me wonder how
Brackenbury has put up with her for so many
years.  In her opinion, Phyllida was pining for
her young soldier and would continue to
pine, so far as I could gather, until she found him.
</p>

<p>
"Is it not better," I asked, "to face facts?
Colonel Butler was certainly attracted, but he
realized in time that he had hardly the means
or the position to qualify him as husband to
Phyllida and son-in-law to Brackenbury.  Very
properly he made himself scarce; and nothing
in life became him so well as his leaving of it.
You say he has not written?  He won't write;&mdash;and
I respect him for it.  But, goodness me,
I hope you're not going to encourage Phyllida
to think that she's broken her heart in a hopeless
passion.  If you won't send her <i>right</i> away (as,
you will have the justice to remember, I felt it
my duty to suggest at the outset), let her come
to me for a few weeks and let me see if London
can't provide something to turn her thoughts."
</p>

<p>
The trouble <i>was</i>, if you will promise not to
tell any one I said so, that Phyllida's <i>vanity</i> was
hurt.  When she was running after this young
man, there was so much publicity that people
began to wonder; they became spied on and
whispered about; when he was summoned to
Brackenbury, every one felt that <i>now</i> they were
going to make certain of him; when he left
before his time, without saying a <i>word</i> to her,
it was naturally assumed that he had run away.
Rather than believe that any man could weary
of her charms, Phyllida will convince herself
that I turned young Butler against her...
Hence this terrible bitterness...
</p>

<p>
If you ask me whether I expected to have
my offer accepted, I will frankly say "no".  I
think Phyllida must enjoy surprises, for she
accepted the invitation at once, though perhaps
a little ungraciously and with a suggestion that,
within limits, any one was welcome to her...
Will was at home; and, though I have never
been able to decide what I should think if he
told me that he was going to marry his cousin,
I was certainly beginning to feel that it was
time for him to find a suitable wife and settle
down.  Will is nearly thirty, and I have
always considered that a popular and
good-looking bachelor is <i>unfairly</i> exposed to
temptation in England.  <i>They</i> will let well alone if
only others would leave <i>them</i> alone...
</p>

<p>
As witness that girl at Morecambe.  I shall
not tell you about that, because I hope&mdash;nay
more; I <i>pray</i>&mdash;that it is all satisfactorily settled;
and, also, I was never told the full story.  It
was enough for me that he had lost a splendid
appointment and now, once more, has <i>nothing</i>
to live on; he must marry or find a job...
When the girl's father came to the house&mdash;one
of these rugged, north-of-England clergymen
who always have the air of intimidating you into
a state of grace&mdash;, it was my husband whom he
insisted on seeing.  I had never known Arthur
in a state of such ungovernable fury.  Bursting
into my room, he stamped up and down,
incoherent, beside himself...  To this day I do
not know what Will is supposed to have done.
The girl kissed him good-night or something.
I suppose I am the last person to condone any
<i>freedom</i>, but she was a mere child ten years
younger than my boy&mdash;what more natural or
innocent?  The old father spied on them...
Hence the storm.  Reading between the lines,
I should conjecture that the girl deliberately
laid herself out to catch Will.  The one time I
saw this Molly Phenton, she seemed an attractive
child, with deep-set, rather appealing eyes;
a good deal of soft brown hair, too, and pretty
hands.  Quiet, simply dressed; a perfect specimen
of "the old country clergyman's pretty
little daughter."  And that, <i>I have no doubt</i>,
was the effect she wanted to achieve with Will,
the appeal of innocence and youth to a palate
grown weary of more sophisticated charms; I
wonder <i>more</i> men are not caught in that way...
Will, I am thankful to say, pulled back before
the trap could close on him; I was really
astounded that the father had the effrontery to
come all the way from Morecambe on what was
nothing less or more than a blackmailing
expedition.  Futile, if nothing else; Will is not
one of those men who find it necessary to buy
popularity by giving presents to all and sundry;
and I am sure he is too prudent to write a girl
foolish letters...
</p>

<p>
"Arthur, do stop walking about," I said,
"and tell me what has happened."
</p>

<p>
Too often, <i>only</i> too often, when Will has
been in trouble of any kind, I have been
excluded on the pretext that this was not a
woman's province.  His own mother!
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?," he shouted.
"Why, we have brought into this world as
choice a young blackguard as any one is ever
likely to meet.  Phenton told me so to my face;
and I had to agree with him.  He said he wished
he were young enough to horse-whip the fellow;
I said I agreed.  He wished the girl had a
brother to do it; I said again that I agreed."
</p>

<p>
I really thought it best to let him wear
himself out...  When a man speaks in that tone
about his own son, when a Christian minister
talks about horse-whipping people...  All these
wild words made rather less than <i>no</i> impression
on me, as I was quite sure that my boy hadn't
written anything that could be used against him.
</p>

<p>
"And what is the outcome of it all?," I
ventured to ask, when the storm had abated.
</p>

<p>
"The outcome?"  When Arthur is moved,
he has a most irritating trick of repeating one's
words.  For thirty years I have tried to break
him of it, but he is obdurate.  "You'd better
find some woman who'll marry the young scamp
and keep him in order.  The sooner the better.
And I wish her joy of him."
</p>

<p>
When Will returned to Mount Street&mdash;he
lived at his club until the wild clergyman
returned to Morecambe&mdash;, I begged for
enlightenment, but he would say nothing.  For
that, I am not ashamed to confess, I respected
him; however badly this Molly Phenton (or
"Molly Wanton," as <i>I</i> prefer to call her) had
behaved, Will was too chivalrous to clear
himself at the expense of a woman&mdash;and this though
I could see that he was worried out of his mind.
To a man, <i>that</i> is a law of the Medes and
Persians...
</p>

<p>
"Son of mine, you must try to forget the
whole thing," I said.  "When you are older,
I am afraid that some of your ideals will be
modified; in future, no doubt, you will be more
on your guard; but you will never be secure
until you are yourself married."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm open to any offer," said Will,
exactly as poor Phyllida had done.
</p>

<p>
I was disquieted, for I could see clearly
that he would indeed never feel secure from this
girl until he was plighted to another woman.
When once a man is "Morning-Posted", as he
would say, all other fancied claims dissolve into
thin air...  The mere sight of the Morecambe
post-mark in those days sent my heart into my
mouth, and I could see that the strain of this
persecution was telling on his nerves.  "Ann
Spenworth," I said to myself, "you must make
up your mind; if he wants to marry Phyllida,
you must not stand in the way." ...
</p>

<p>
All my life I have shrunk from the responsibility
of interfering with the destiny of a boy
and girl in love.  The relationship is too delicate,
the consequences are too grave.  Before Phyllida
came, I reviewed the position and decided to
make no change.
</p>

<p>
"Your cousin," I told Will, "is coming to
us for a few weeks, and I wish her to carry
back pleasant memories of her visit.  It is no
secret to you that she has been disappointed
through fancying herself in love with a man
who could never have been a suitable husband
for the Earl of Brackenbury's daughter.  We
have to be kind to her; and, if I know anything
of girls, you will find that one who for the
moment feels forlorn and uncared-for will repay
the affection of him who can overcome her sense
of loneliness and convince her that the whole
world is not indifferent to her happiness.  The
labour and heat of the day," I said, "must
inevitably fall on you.  I cannot hope that your
cousin will be amused by the society of a dull
old woman like me; and I am unequal to the
physical strain of accompanying her to dances
and plays.  If you will relieve me of this burden,
you will be doing us both a kindness; and,
though I cannot hope to repay you, I should
like you to feel that you may draw on me for
any expenses to which you may be put in the
course of keeping her amused."
</p>

<p>
Some people&mdash;especially the <i>really</i>
good-natured&mdash;feel that they owe themselves a
grumble before ever consenting to do a kind
act.  Will is like that; unless you knew him
well, you might think that he made difficulties
before putting himself out in the slightest
degree, but on this occasion he promised
without demur.  Perhaps he hoped that in playing
cavalier to Phyllida he would turn his own
thoughts from that unhappy episode at
Morecambe; I prefer to think that, having now
suffered himself, he was more sensitive to
others' suffering...  I did not enquire how
they spent their time; they were cousins and
could go about together without being spied on
and whispered about; I made over the car to
them, kept Will supplied with little sums to
cover their amusements and asked no questions.
From start to finish, he behaved splendidly.
I am not being unkind if I say that Phyllida
was sometimes a little <i>difficile</i>...  You have
noticed, I expect, that, when people of a certain
class become possessed of a motor-car for the
first time, their ambition is to see how fast they
can drive it.  Phyllida, I am afraid&mdash;and I was
sorry to see it, though I could hardly hope for
any other fruit of poor Ruth's upbringing; you
may copy the mannerisms of others, but you
can only give forth the breeding that is in you...
I have lost the thread...  Ah, yes!  Phyllida,
I am afraid, seeing a loyal and attentive cavalier
always by her side...  She tried my Will very
hard; I sometimes felt that she was deliberately
experimenting to see how much he would bear.
</p>

<p>
Among places of amusement it was always <i>her</i>
choice that prevailed; Will has a weakness for
these <i>revues</i>&mdash;"you can at least smoke there,"
he says&mdash;; Phyllida seemed to have developed
into a remorseless blue-stocking.  By day she
wore him out at exhibitions...  When he was
not cooling his heels in a shop...  At night he
was expected to stay up till all hours to bring
her home from dances.  And so forth and so on...
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she tried us all rather hard.  Money
seemed to <i>melt</i> in her hands; and, though I
did not grudge her my last penny if it was going
to turn her thoughts, I am not ashamed to
confess that I have reached an age where I set
great store by my personal comfort.  When
you have lived for thirty years under the same
vine and fig-tree, you begin to regard your
home as a frame and setting which you are not
too anxious to share with any one; hitherto my
guests, when any have done me the honour to
make my house their own, have recognized that
the hostess <i>has</i> the first claim on their
consideration.  Not so Phyllida, who seems to have been
brought up in a very different school.  She was
<i>ruthless</i> in her unpunctuality at meals and in
her general disregard of every one else's
convenience; plans were chopped and changed up
to the last moment, and there were times when
I felt that she was deliberately making everything
as difficult as possible&mdash;almost as though
the absurd old feud had not been forgotten and
I had put myself at her mercy.  More than anything
else I felt the loss of the car.  They used
it so unmercifully that I hourly expected the
man to give notice; and in the meantime poor
Aunt Ann was left to go by taxi&mdash;when she
could find one.
</p>

<p>
I ought never to have lent it?  My dear,
you are preaching to the converted, but I have
a reason different from yours.  I was standing
helplessly outside Covent Garden one night,
when a taxi providentially drove up and I got
into it.  Only when I was half-way home did I
remember that I had not told the man where
to take me.  Laugh, if you will; but I have
never been so frightened!  The wildest stories
of kidnapping and robbery surged into my head.
I was wearing my tiara, and the man had made
a bee-line for me...  Yet we were driving the
shortest way to Mount Street, and the mystery
was not explained until the man&mdash;with delightful
and most unexpected civility&mdash;jumped down
from the box, opened the door and stood cap
in hand, waiting to help me out.  Almost as
though one had been Royalty...
</p>

<p>
"You have forgotten me, Lady Ann?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
And then I'm not sure that the second
shock wasn't worse than the first.  Colonel
Butler!  Phyllida's soldier-hero, driving a cab!
He had won a Military Cross and a D.S.O.&mdash;with
a bar, I believe; he had always seemed a
manly, straightforward young fellow&mdash;and here
he was driving a cab!  "This&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;"  I felt
myself apostrophizing Phyllida, Brackenbury,
that poor fool Ruth&mdash;"this is what I've saved
you from." ... And then one had a certain
revulsion of feeling: the pity of it! ... And
then stark horror!  If Phyllida met him!  Not
<i>then</i>; I knew she was at a dance with Will and
would not be back for hours, but at any moment
when I was not there to protect her from herself.
I recalled her dreadful threat that, if she
saw or heard of Hilary Butler, she would fling
herself into his arms and beg him to marry
her...
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;of course I remember you," I said.
</p>

<p>
He smiled&mdash;without embarrassment of any
kind&mdash;and walked up the steps with me.
</p>

<p>
"Have you a key?," he asked, "or shall I ring?"
</p>

<p>
He <i>spoke</i> so nicely...  If you like, just a
touch of what I think must be West Country;
but, when things were at their worst and I felt
that we had to be prepared for anything, it
was a slight consolation to know that he could
easily have it drilled out of him...  I could
have done the same for Ruth twenty-three years
ago, but she seemed to pride herself on her
provincialism.
</p>

<p>
Now I wonder what you would have done...
When Phyllida was nursing him at the
hospital&mdash;or just afterwards&mdash;, he was <i>always</i>
in Mount Street, lunching, dining; before they
took to going about by themselves <i>quite</i> so
much, we had all been to the play, he had seen
us home&mdash;just like this&mdash;and asked me&mdash;just
like this&mdash;whether I had my key or whether he
should ring...  There was no one at home;
even Arthur was in the country.  I felt I
<i>couldn't</i> suddenly freeze...
</p>

<p>
"I have my key, thanks," I said.  "Won't
you come in for a moment?"
</p>

<p>
He stopped his engine and came in...
Now, I wonder what you would have done, if
you'd been in <i>his</i> place? ... He took off coat
and gloves (he was wearing quite a presentable
blue suit underneath), and I led the way into
the morning-room, where I offered him
cigarettes and something to drink ... wondering
the whole time, don't you know, why one
had <i>done</i> it and how long he would stay...
<i>With</i> the coat and cap he seemed to divest
himself of what I can only call the professional
manner; asked me if I wouldn't have a little
of my own brandy, commented on some new
curtains I'd bought when we did up the house
after Hilda Culroyd's illness.  <i>Absolutely</i> at
home...
</p>

<p>
"How is Phyllida?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"My niece is very well, thank you," I
answered, hardly caring&mdash;at that moment&mdash;to
notice the familiarity.  "And what have <i>you</i>
been doing with yourself since last we met?,"
I made haste to ask.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as you see," he said, "I've turned
taxi-man.  Owner-driver.  One in action, four
in support and nine training."
</p>

<p>
I had to beg for enlightenment.  And I am
not ashamed to confess that his explanation,
when it came, greatly increased my respect
for him.  The father, one gathered, was an
estate-agent and surveyor in Devonshire, <i>highly</i>
esteemed, but neither a millionaire himself nor
in a position to make his son a millionaire simply
by wishing it.  The boy had realized
everything&mdash;war-bonus, wound-gratuity and the rest&mdash;and
had invested in a car which he learned to drive
himself.  One always <i>suspected</i> that here was a
fortune for any young man who was not too
proud to take off his coat, and so it proved:
the one car became two, the two four and
five&mdash;hence his expression "one in action and four
in support."  Now, I was given to understand,
he was launching out more widely and
negotiating for the purchase of <i>nine</i> more.  A few
of his friends&mdash;young fellows like himself
discharged from the army&mdash;were coming into
partnership with him; and in six months he
hoped to give up driving himself and to turn his
business into a limited company, partly taxis
and partly those really magnificent private cars
that one sees at the opera and everywhere, filled
by people who one <i>knows</i> could not afford to
buy such things at the present prices...
</p>

<p>
I complimented him <i>most warmly</i> on his
enterprise and determination.
</p>

<p>
"It was so obvious," he answered.  "Stand
outside any theatre or restaurant on a wet night,
and you'll agree with me.  There are thousands
of people <i>living</i> in London, <i>hundreds</i> of
thousands coming to London for a few nights, who
need a car and can't afford to keep one.  By
the time you've ordered dinner at fifteen
shillings a head and champagne at two guineas a
bottle and brandy at five shillings a glass and
cigars at four shillings a-piece and stalls at twelve
and six and anything else that occurs to you at
any price that occurs to any one else, you don't
grudge an extra guinea for a car that takes you
from your house to the restaurant, from the
restaurant to the theatre and from the theatre
home again.  You'd spend the best part of a
guinea in fares and tips&mdash;without any certainty.
For two guineas I give you certainty and a
private car.  In two years no one who can afford
to dine at Claridge's or go to the stalls will
<i>dream</i> of going any other way.  Whether it pays
you can judge from the progress I've made in
less than a year."
</p>

<p>
Like all enthusiasts on their own hobby, he
<i>deluged</i> me with figures until my poor head
reeled.  I did not complain, however, because
I felt that so long as he was doing sensible hard
work he would be unlikely to return and disturb
our peace of mind.  Apart from the one formal
question he had not mentioned Phyllida; and I
was strengthened in the belief which I had always
held that it was a momentary infatuation and
that he proved he had overcome it when he
declined to communicate with her.
</p>

<p>
I <i>hope</i> I did nothing to suggest that one
can have too much even of percentages and
running expenses and allowances for depreciation
and the like, but he jumped up suddenly
and said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I mustn't keep you and I mustn't
be late for my next job.  I hope your brother
and Lady Brackenbury are all right?  I see
Culroyd is married."
</p>

<p>
"They are all very well," I said, as I walked
with him to the door.
</p>

<p>
"If I may ask a favour, Lady Ann,
don't tell any of them what I'm doing," he
begged.
</p>

<p>
Do you know, that was the only jarring
note...  The first recognition, of course, was a
<i>shock</i>.  "D.S.O. Taxi-driver," don't you
know?  In some strange way it <i>grates</i>...
Having <i>taken</i> the plunge, our young friend, I
felt, was entitled to the highest credit, and
anything like false shame would have been
discordant.
</p>

<p>
"They would be the first," I said, "to join
me in applauding your resolution and hoping
for your success."
</p>

<p>
"But I want it to be a surprise," he said.
</p>

<p>
At that, my heart <i>sank</i>.
</p>

<p>
"But why?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"For Phyllida's sake," he answered.  "I've
not seen her since that week-end at the Hall,
I've not written to her; and she can't write to
me, because she doesn't know where I am.  I
presume she's not engaged, because I've seen no
announcement of it, but I don't want to do
anything that may stand in her light.  If my
present scheme fails, I shall have to start on
something else; if it succeeds&mdash;and when it
succeeds&mdash;, it will be time enough for me to see
what's happened to her.  I've never forgotten
our talk.  If I didn't love a girl, I might
cheerfully marry her for her money; but, when I <i>do</i>
love her, I couldn't bear to have people even
hinting such a thing.  You told me that she had
four thousand of her own; when I can go to her
father and say that I'm making more than
that&mdash;clear profit to my own pocket&mdash;, I shan't be
afraid to look any one in the face.  But I've
not asked her to wait for me; and, if in the
meantime she meets any one that she wants to
marry more, no one will ever hear me complain."
</p>

<p>
And then he buttoned himself into his coat&mdash;even
now I couldn't <i>quite</i> get over the disc
with the number on it, hanging from a button-hole&mdash;,
picked up his cap and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
I walked to the door,&mdash;and then my heart
seemed to stop.  You may remember that the
horn of our car has a note which I at least find
unmistakable.  I heard it in the distance, I
heard it coming nearer.  Phyllida and Will!  It
was only twelve, and I had not expected them
for hours.  Evidently the dance had not been to
their liking.  I <i>prayed</i> that I might prove equal
to the crisis...
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Butler!," I cried.  (One never
troubled to think whether he should <i>rightly</i> be
given his military rank).  "Shut that door!
Run upstairs to the drawing-room!  Hide there
till I fetch you, but on no account turn on the
light!  My niece is coming now; if you want
to avoid her..."
</p>

<p>
He acted with great decision and literally
<i>dashed</i> upstairs.  I heard the door gently closing
as Will fitted his key into the lock...  My dear,
I am too old for excitements of this kind; my
heart was <i>beating</i>; I had no idea what to say if
they asked me why a taxi was standing there
unattended.  Oh, and I felt <i>sure</i> Phyllida would
say she had left her work or her book in the
drawing-room...
</p>

<p>
It was agony!  I <i>could</i> not persuade them to
go to bed.  First of all they wanted to know why
<i>I</i> was still up, then they must needs tell me
about their party, then Phyllida wanted a
cigarette, then Will wanted to give her some
soda-water.  One false start after another...
When at <i>last</i> I thought I had set them moving,
Phyllida sat down again and said:
</p>

<p>
"Will dear, see if there are any letters for
me, there's an angel."
</p>

<p>
Do you know, I was so much <i>obsessed</i> by
the thought of that man in the drawing-room
that I was <i>blind</i> to everything else.  As my
boy went into the hall, I felt that I had <i>seen</i> a
change without noticing it, if you understand
me.  Will was transformed, elated ... and
there was a new gentleness about Phyllida.
When he brought the letters to her, I could see
that he pressed her hand; and she sighed
wistfully and then smiled.  <i>Now</i> I could understand
why they complained that the dance was so
crowded, no room to sit, impossible even to
talk...
</p>

<p>
"Read those upstairs, dear Phyllida," I begged.
</p>

<p>
And I took her arm and led her up, past
that terrifying drawing-room, into safety.  Will
... When I returned, he wanted to talk; but
I implored him to go up and let me come to him
in a moment.  He was curious, mystified ... but
at least he could not doubt my earnestness.
Then at last I released my prisoner and hurried
him through the hall and into the street.  When
I had shut the door I leaned against it, panting.
I couldn't walk, I could hardly stand...
</p>

<p>
"And now, Will?," I said, when I was able
to drag myself upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing much to tell&mdash;as yet," he
answered.  "You've probably seen that she's
been getting steadily more miserable the last
few days.  I asked her to-night what it was all
about, though I knew that she was eating her
heart out for this Butler fellow.  She would only
say that she was unhappy and lonely; and I told
her that was all rot, because any number of men
would be in love with her if she gave them half
a chance.  Then she said it was no good, because
she couldn't give them any love in return, her
heart was dead...  The usual rot a girl talks.
I told her that, so far as I was concerned, I'd
gladly risk all that; and she said she didn't care
who she married or what became of her and
she wished she'd never been born...  That,"
said Will, "was nearer by a long chalk than I've
ever been before; and you may take it as absolutely
certain that, if she doesn't hear anything
of Butler pretty soon...  She dried up and
began to talk of something else when I tried
to pin her to a day, but she was quite decent
to me as we drove home."
</p>

<p>
I could say nothing until I had been given
time to digest his news.  Whoever Will marries
must have <i>some</i> money; he has earned nothing
since he resigned his post at Morecambe...
Perhaps dear Phyllida thinks a little too much
about herself to be the perfect wife for Will,
but it is not cynical to say that, if you look
for perfection in woman or man, you will never
marry.  One has to consider the balance of
advantage...  I did most earnestly want to see
Will established in life and settled down before
those dreadful blackmailing Phentons could
make another descent on us.  And it would
do Phyllida so much good to marry...
</p>

<p>
After all my excitements and alarms, I could
not sleep for sheer thankfulness.  And, when
my tea was brought me and Phyllida of all
people came in with it, I felt that now at last
my Will must have dropped the handkerchief
and she was coming to tell me that she had
picked it up.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, what makes you so energetic?,"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
As a rule she insisted on lying in bed until
all hours and having her breakfast brought to
her there, <i>making</i> work for my unhappy
servants.
</p>

<p>
"I want to know if you can tell me Hilary
Butler's address?," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I've never heard it," I told her.  "How
should I?"
</p>

<p>
"Apparently he came here yesterday.
When I went down to get my bag, I found
his gloves in the hall.  But they only have his
initials."
</p>

<p>
I <i>did</i> wish that Phyllida had been less
collected and businesslike!  Hard, not daring
to let herself go...  I ought to have <i>looked</i>, I
suppose, to see that he was leaving nothing
behind, but one cannot think of everything.
And now I knew that Phyllida would start all
over again...
</p>

<p>
Yet one must <i>expect</i> an occasional relapse...
</p>

<p>
"I've never heard it," I told her again.
</p>

<p>
She did not trouble to ask anything more...
Just looked at me for a moment.  I made
up my mind that her visit must be cut short;
if I had met Colonel Butler, <i>she</i> might.  And
I have no doubt of any kind that she would
do what she threatens and <i>ask</i> him to marry
her.  And he wouldn't refuse.  Moreover, I am
not <i>made</i> of money, as she and Will seemed to
think...
</p>

<p>
Brackenbury was a fool not to send her
<i>right</i> away, as I recommended.  Nothing is
decided; I sometimes wonder whether anything
ever <i>will</i> be decided.  We are precisely where
we stood before...
</p>

<p>
I had time to warn Will, I am thankful to
say.  A girl who shilly-shallies like that...
I shall make the best of it, if I have to; but I
am not sure she is the sort of wife for my
boy...

VIII
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH REFERS TO HER DIARY
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
It is only a question of habit.  When I first
went to Italy, at the age of sixteen, my dear
mother insisted that I should keep a diary, and
I have kept one ever since.  Goodness me, I
am more likely to overlook my letters or the
morning paper than forget to write up my
journal.  Sometimes it is only a few lines, for
the spacious days are over, I am a dull old
woman, and the most I ask of life is that I
may be allowed to live.  Very often I let months
go by without turning back to see what I have
written; but the record is there if I ever want
to consult it.  Usually at the end of the year
one likes to take stock...
</p>

<p>
Not that it is very cheerful reading, alas!
But at our age we must expect that.  Another
year gone, when perhaps we cannot hope to see
so very many more; another hope dashed and
yet another deferred, making the heart sick;
gaps in the circle of those one loves; increasing
frailty or ill-health; and that indefinable,
inexplicable narrowing of outlook, interest,
enthusiasm&mdash;and with us, I am afraid, of
worldly circumstance.  Inevitable...  For
oneself, perhaps, one does not mind it, but it is
sometimes heart-rending to see the boys and
girls setting out with those high hopes that we
have been compelled, one by one, to discard;
heart-rending, too, when those who seemed to
walk with their heads on a level with the stars
trip and sprawl like the rest...
</p>

<p>
No, I assure you I was not thinking of any
one in particular.  The feeling returns with the
season and is quite general.  One could find
particular applications, no doubt, very near at
hand.  Begin where you will: my brother-in-law
Spenworth...  I wonder what we shall be
thinking of him in a year's time; divorced,
remarried&mdash;and nobody one penny the worse!
I am not ashamed to confess that, when the
word "divorce" is mentioned, I am translated
to another sphere...  Groping blindly among
things I don't understand and don't <i>want</i> to
understand...  Say what you will, we were <i>not</i>
so lax a generation ago; those who fell remained
where they fell ... or climbed back with effort,
difficulty <i>and an acknowledgement of
wrong-doing</i>.  Not as of right...  The new Lady
Spenworth I hardly know; she who marries a
man that has been put away...  I have not
refused to meet her, but the opportunity has
not come my way.  Whether she will be able
to <i>hold</i> him...  Perhaps if she presents him
with an heir ... though I have had to change
my views on <i>that</i> subject, as you know.  Oh,
I can speak about it now; and I shall never
forget, when things were at their blackest, it
was <i>you</i> who came to me with your divine
sympathy.  I could tell you the whole story if
you truly honestly would not be bored; <i>your</i>
discretion has been proved...  I have lost the
thread...
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!&mdash;the family...  My nephew
Culroyd&mdash;and Hilda?  I am humbly thankful to
say that there has been no catastrophe so far,
though when the first, honeymoon intoxication
wears off...  Long may it be delayed, for they
are the one bright spot in my poor brother
Brackenbury's life.  That pathetic child Phyllida
is still breaking her heart over the cabman-colonel
whom I, if you please, am supposed to
have set against her in order to keep her for
my boy.  Thank goodness, she does not <i>know</i>
he is driving a cab!  Breaking her heart or
pretending to.  And I really think my brother
encourages her.  He wouldn't send her <i>right</i>
away as I advised; and now he pats her hand
and looks worried when she comes down <i>boasting</i>
that she hasn't slept.  And Ruth does the
same...  I don't want to <i>bring</i> bad luck by
talking about it; but I sometimes wonder how
much longer Brackenbury will put up with
that&mdash;<i>invertebrate woman</i>; I sometimes fear that
the record of the year will shew that there, too,
the blow has fallen.  We have seen to our cost
that the most devoted husband and father may
sometimes go apparently quite mad...  I
feel that Phyllida, with her youth and her
looks and her money, is being so shamefully
<i>wasted</i>...
</p>

<p>
But, until she shakes off her obsession, I
should pity any man who tried to marry her.
At one time my boy Will seemed attracted to
her out of compassion for her loneliness and
misery.  Those were anxious days, I can assure
you, though I should have been glad to see
Will safely married to almost any one.  He is
undoubtedly of an age; and what I called "the
Morecambe menace"...  We have heard
nothing of the Phentons (you know, I always
called her Miss Molly "Wanton") since the
father conducted his blackmailing descent upon
us, protesting that Will had made this girl an
offer of marriage, talking about horse-whips.  I
hope and pray that it is all over, but one can
never be certain.  For the last fortnight I have
succeeded in <i>not</i> thinking about them; I suppose
I should be grateful to Arthur for turning
my thoughts...
</p>

<p>
You are quite right!  I have tried to avoid
speaking bitterly <i>to</i> him, I must not speak
bitterly <i>about</i> him.  But, when the news came
to me, I said: "Now indeed the bottom has
fallen out of the world."  It was towards the
end of the year, and I had been turning the
pages of my journal.  Catastrophe, disappointment,
anxiety...  But, whatever storms may
blow, I said, I can always trust my husband.
Arthur was my rock and anchor.  He and I
seemed to stand erect, with our heads level with
the stars, while these others, one after another,
tripped and sprawled.  And then Arthur too...
</p>

<p>
I tell you now, as I told you then: I had
heard and suspected <i>nothing</i> until you put me
on my guard.  I truly believe that the person
most affected is commonly the last to hear...
And Arthur's way of life made it almost
impossible for me even to guess: for years he
has spent as much time away from me as with
me&mdash;his board-meetings in London and
Birmingham, his shooting ... and, with Will at
home, there was so much <i>unhappy</i> friction that
I was not sorry when one or other went off and
left me in peace for a few days.  I did not
enquire; so was it surprising that, if the
board-meetings and so on were simply a <i>blind</i>, I should
be the last person to hear?  So with money.
My father-in-law's will was so iniquitous...
Cheniston and the house in Grosvenor Square
went naturally to Spenworth; but every penny,
with the exception of a wretched thousand a
year for Arthur,&mdash;that was sheer wickedness.
<i>My</i> dear father would have done more for me
if he could; but he had impoverished himself
when he was ambassador at Vienna, and, until
Brackenbury sold himself to Ruth, we were all
very, very poor.  The result has been that
throughout my married life we have been forced
to pinch and scrape.  You may say that the
house in Mount Street was an extravagance, but
one had to live somewhere.  It was for one's
friends rather than oneself; I could not ask the
princess to dine with me in Bayswater...
Pinch and scrape, scrape and pinch.  Arthur
made a fair income by his director's fees, but
I had dreadful moments when I thought of the
future.  Spenworth will do no more than he
has already done&mdash;that we know&mdash;; when I lay
at death's door and begged him with what might
have been my last breath to make a settlement
on Will&mdash;his own nephew...  And at Brackenbury
it is canny, north-country little Ruth who
holds the purse-strings ... and dispenses her
charity, offering to pay for my operation and
reminding me that, when Will was at Eton,
the bills came to them...  I have felt for more
years than I like to count that pinching and
scraping are my appointed lot...
</p>

<p>
Of recent months the task became almost
too much for my powers.  Not only the cost
of living...  Will had lost this Morecambe
appointment without finding another.  Arthur
complained that figure-head directors were not
in so great request as formerly; he was shame-faced
about it, as though his pride were hurt;
I did not then imagine that he had to give me
less money because he was giving more in
another quarter...
</p>

<p>
And you will remember that, when you told
me, I refused to believe it.  Goodness me, I am
not so vain as to think that the man who once
loved me <i>must</i> always love me, but there is
such a thing as loyalty&mdash;and gratitude.  I had
trusted him ... and that was enough; I did
not need to tell him&mdash;or you&mdash;or even myself
that he had enjoyed the best years of my life,
that I was an old woman while he was still&mdash;thanks
to me&mdash;a young man, that I had borne
him a son and worn myself out before my time
in scheming and contriving for the comfort and
well-being of them both...
</p>

<p>
It was brave of you to tell me, to insist on
my knowing... and <i>believing</i>.  I was <i>dazed</i>.
That Arthur should be giving her dresses and
jewellery, when he could not afford to redecorate
his wife's house...  And apparently it was the
common talk of the clubs; and no doubt kind
friends were secretly pitying me...  The last
infatuation of the middle-aged man&mdash;they were
telling one another that I was six years Arthur's
senior&mdash;and what could you expect?  As if I
had made any secret of my age!  It is in the
books.  And they were, perhaps, wondering
how soon he would outgrow it and how much
I knew and whether I minded...  <i>There</i> was
the rub&mdash;this savage, impertinent curiosity.
What business of theirs if my husband
humiliated me?  And, strangely enough, one
has so often seen it with other women and
somehow always fancied that it would never
happen to oneself.  The swan-song...  As a
man feels that his youth is slipping out of his
grasp, he makes this one last despairing effort.
And love at that age is like a blow from a
sledge-hammer; Arthur was prepared to run
away with the woman.  Indeed I know what
I am talking about.  Then, I felt, it <i>was</i> time
for me to intervene...
</p>

<p>
You had been clever enough to find out
the address&mdash;the house, by the way, Arthur did
<i>not</i> give her.  She told me so, but without that
I knew enough of his finances to realize that it
was physically impossible&mdash;; and all the way
there I tried to understand this strange streak
which apparently runs through all men.  The
old phrase: "Sowing one's wild oats."
... When I married Arthur, he had never had an
<i>affaire</i> of <i>any</i> kind with <i>any</i> one; and so for
thirty years.  Am I very cynical in thinking
that perhaps it would have been better if he
<i>had</i>? ... Spenworth, on the other hand, had been
tossed from one woman's arms to another's ever
since he was a lad at Eton.  You entered his
house and never knew whom you would find at
the head of his table&mdash;except that it would not
be the one you had seen there a month before;
the only difference that marriage made to him
was that, while Kathleen sat at the head of his
table, he dined elsewhere.  Now that he has
married again in middle life, one has no sort of
guarantee.  It seems impossible to frame <i>any</i>
rules for a man of that age...
</p>

<p>
I had not spoken to Arthur beforehand, of
course.  He would have spoiled everything.
What I wanted was a cold, passionless talk with
this Mrs. Templedown.  Two women, even in
<i>our</i> position, could understand each other:
neither of us wanted a scandal, I was prepared
to admit even that she might be genuinely fond
of Arthur and would try&mdash;according to her lights&mdash;to
do the best for him.  I need hardly say that
I did not dream of intimidating&mdash;Arthur was
her <i>property</i>&mdash;nor of bribing&mdash;goodness me,
what had I to offer?  Nor did I feel constrained
to beg for mercy or to ask what manner of life
she proposed to leave for me.  I hardly think
that <i>pride</i> held me in check, but&mdash;somehow&mdash;to
go on one's knees to a young woman who started
life on the stage was hardly...  Well, as my boy
would say, "It is not done."  I knew she
was clever, I hoped to find her sensible;
and then the only thing was to decide what to <i>do</i>...
</p>

<p>
Of course I did not send up my name...
</p>

<p>
"Say that a lady wishes to see her," I told
the maid.
</p>

<p>
And I was shewn upstairs readily enough.
<i>Not</i> into the drawing-room; I think that class
of person lives entirely in her bedroom.  She
was lying on the sofa in a kimono and&mdash;so far
as I could judge from the generous opportunities
which she insisted on giving me&mdash;nothing else;
a lovely animal, as she was at pains that I should
see, with perfect skin, a great mane of copper
hair and golden-brown eyes.  Very red lips, very
white teeth; I was reminded of a soft, beautiful
lion-cub.  She moved and stretched herself like
an animal, speaking as though she were only
half-awake.  I don't think she could have been
more than twenty.  She left the stage to marry
a man in the Air Force, I understand, and he
was killed at the end of the war, leaving her
very ill-provided-for...  "Seductive" was the
word I was trying to think of...
</p>

<p>
"It's easy to see why men should fall down
and worship <i>you</i>," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Who's in love with me now?," she asked
with the laugh of a child, <i>exulting</i> in her beauty,
as it were, until in a flash I saw that her whole
life was natural to her...  Inevitable, I might
say.
</p>

<p>
"Arthur Spenworth," I told her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's a dear old thing," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"He is my husband," I said.
</p>

<p>
I might have added "and the father of our
boy," but I would make no <i>appeal</i>; I had come
there to decide dispassionately what had to be
done...  The woman jumped up and faced me,
but I stood my ground.  Her eyes kept changing
in expression, and I saw that she was first
bewildered ... and then defiant ... then curious
... then a little ashamed, then defiant again
and once more bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Well?," she said; and then in spite of
herself, as it were, "You're not a bit like what
I expected."
</p>

<p>
"Older perhaps?," I asked.  "My dear
young lady, my husband and I are much of an
age, but he carries his years better.  Why,
goodness me, you are a child!  Our boy must
be ten years older than you...  Won't you ask
me to sit down?  Walking upstairs makes me
out of breath, and I want to have a little talk
with you.  I have only just heard of this; and
I want to know what is to be done.  You will
find me a reasonable woman, I hope, and
perhaps I know too much of the world to judge
hastily or reproach easily.  Won't you tell me
everything, so that we may understand better
how we are situated?"
</p>

<p>
Do you know, <i>because</i> I remained dispassionate,
I felt in a moment that I was holding my
own and in another moment that I was gaining
ground.  I who had walked upstairs wondering
whether my knees would give way under me...
It was Mrs. Templedown who was embarrassed...
And I had not sought to make myself a ruler
or a judge...
</p>

<p>
I will not weary you with the story.  Arthur
had met her&mdash;in the train from Birmingham!
Is there not dignity and distinction in that?
He had asked her to dine with him on reaching
London, they had met three or four times,
Arthur had begun giving her little presents.
How much one can <i>ever</i> believe of such a
woman's story I do not profess to judge.  She
<i>vowed</i> that their relations were innocent, that
her husband's death had left her heart-broken
and that she was simply and sincerely grateful
to any man who shewed her a little kindness;
in that class I gather it is only natural for every
girl to have some benevolent elderly protector
who takes her out to dinner and gives her little
presents.  If it had not been Arthur, I was to
understand, it would have been some one else.
I confess that her ingenuousness rang a little
hollow when she betrayed how intimately and
accurately she knew who he was&mdash;the connection
with Spenworth on one side and with Brackenbury
on the other; like the rest of them, she
hunted with one quarry&mdash;or one type of
quarry&mdash;definitely in view...
</p>

<p>
After the little presents came the big
presents&mdash;dresses, jewellery and sums of money which
she did not specify.  One thought of the <i>rags</i>
that one had worn oneself during the war...
No shame in telling me about <i>that</i>!  She had
nothing of her own except this house which the
husband had left her, and Arthur would have
been hurt if she had refused...  So charming!
So delicate&mdash;on both sides...  By and by Arthur
seems to have become more exacting, but the
girl vowed again that she kept him at arm's
length&mdash;knowing her own value, one presumes.
I did not enquire very closely into this aspect of
the campaign, as I knew only too well what
was coming.  When everything else failed, he
would have to offer her marriage&mdash;by way of
the Divorce Court.
</p>

<p>
"And that is how things stand now?," I
asked, as she came to the end of her story.
</p>

<p>
"That's what he <i>wants</i>," she answered.
"Oh, but I can't discuss it with you, Lady
Ann."
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lady," I said, "that is just
what we have to do&mdash;quite dispassionately, to
decide what's best.  He is my husband, I love
him in spite of everything; you love him too, I
judge, and we have to put our heads together.
You will go away with him, I take it?"
</p>

<p>
It was then that she began to cry.  I knew
it would come sooner or later.  <i>Convulsively</i>...
I have told you that she was nothing more
nor less than a child...
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"To France?  Next Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
It was no second-sight on my part, I can
assure you.  Arthur had arranged to visit Paris
and Lyons&mdash;on business, <i>I</i> was told&mdash;, and the
guess was natural, though Mrs. Templedown
seemed to think I was some sort of witch.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered again.  And then&mdash;really,
you know, for all the world as though
we were at a play: "Oh, don't torture me!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Torture</i> her...?
</p>

<p>
"And then," I said, "my husband will write
to tell me he loves you and has been unfaithful
to me and is never coming back and I had better
divorce him and he is sorry for the unhappiness
he is causing me..."
</p>

<p>
Those terrible letters that the papers always
publish.  <i>I</i> never read them myself.  In the
school in which I was brought up, divorce lay
beyond the pale: "Whom God hath joined..."
</p>

<p>
"And then you <i>will</i> divorce him, won't
you?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Really, you know, it was almost comic!  She
was afraid, after <i>plunging</i> herself in dishonour,
that I might refuse to divorce Arthur so that she
could never marry him.
</p>

<p>
"If he asks me," I promised.  "I am thinking
solely of his happiness.  He could not live
with you unless you were married&mdash;I am not
now thinking of <i>Right</i> or <i>Wrong</i>; it would
cause too great a scandal, and he would have to
resign his various public positions.  I only hope
that the divorce will not compel him to do that,
for you will both be entirely dependent on the
fees that he earns.  We find it hard enough to
live on his income as it is, by ceaseless scraping
and pinching, denying ourselves little luxuries...
I hope you are a good house-keeper? ...
</p>

<p>
Do you know, as soon as I said it, I realized
what an absurd question it was.  One look at
her, one glance at the room, the least spark of
imagination, any guess at what she was and
what her life had been!  An economical
housekeeper indeed!  I wish I could describe her
room to you: great bowls and vases of the most
expensive flowers, boxes of sweets, cigarettes;
all the magazines and illustrated papers that one
really does think twice about before buying...
Clothes, too...  I am sure that even my niece
Phyllida or Culroyd's wife, who seem to have
money to burn, would not have quite such a
profusion.  <i>Lingerie</i>, gloves, handkerchiefs, the
<i>finest</i> silk stockings&mdash;and everything thrown
about on floor and chairs like so much waste-paper.
And I in <i>rags</i> that truly honestly I am
ashamed for my maid to see...  Her dressing-table
alone supported a small fortune&mdash;bottles
and boxes and looking-glasses and brushes that
really made me feel a pauper.  The door of her
bathroom was open&mdash;in that class it is a point of
honour never to shut anything or put anything
away&mdash;, and I saw the most extravagant array of
salts and soaps and powders and scents ... like
the tiring-room of some great eastern queen.
Things I simply couldn't afford; we discontinued
bath-salts when the war broke out and one had
an excuse for economizing, and we have never
resumed them.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what your plans are,
Mrs. Templedown," I said.  "If you return to the
stage, everything may be different, but I know
my husband's income to a penny.  The court
will no doubt insist that he makes what provision
he can for my son and myself; I should be
greatly surprised if he could allow you more than
about a thousand a year."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose it's possible to manage on
that," she said.
</p>

<p>
It was <i>pathetic</i>!  Money had no <i>meaning</i> for
her!  And, so long as other people paid the bills,
what else could you expect?  It must have
required twice that sum to keep that beautiful
body of hers in its present embarrassing state of
semi-nudity.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand pounds&mdash;at present prices,": I
said very distinctly, "for two people&mdash;to cover
everything&mdash;, it's not much, you will find.  And,
if you have been used to luxury, you will miss
it more than a person who has always had to live
on a small income.  That is your affair, of course,
and you mustn't think me brutal if I tell you
candidly that I'm considering my husband as
much as I can and you not at all.  You are
young enough to take care of yourself, but he
needs a great deal of looking after..."
</p>

<p>
I paused to let my words sink in.  Of course
she didn't believe me!  Because Arthur had
squandered a few hundreds on her, she thought
he could produce thousands merely by pressing
a bell; and, when she had sucked him dry, she
expected Spenworth and Brackenbury to come
forward.  I <i>had</i> to tell her how things really
were...  We should <i>all</i> be poorer than we are
by a divorce...  Though she clearly did not
believe me, she was impressed; she was
thinking. In that class one doesn't think very
much, apparently.  I gathered that she could
not go back to the stage; she had no position
there and could only hope for work in the
chorus...
</p>

<p>
"Old Boy says it will be all right," she said,
and I could see that she was exhausted by the
rare exertion of thinking.  Until you have heard
your husband described as "Old Boy" by a
half-naked chorus-girl who is slowly bleeding him
to death, you have not realized how highly your
self-restraint may be tested...
</p>

<p>
"I don't suggest more than that it will be
an effort," I said.  "My dear young lady, I
speak with some knowledge.  You were married
for a few months to a husband whom you hardly
saw and who spent what money he had like
water.  I have kept house for more than thirty
years on an income which you would not think
large, but which is bigger than anything you can
hope for.  I know something of men and their
ways and their extravagances and humours.  It
will be a great change, and I only hope that you
will prove equal to it."  I pointed&mdash;not unkindly&mdash;at
the litter in her room.  "I trust for your
sake as well as his that you will learn habits of
tidiness."
</p>

<p>
"Is Old Boy a fusser?," she asked.
</p>

<p>
I wish to be judged by results.  If you tell
me that the end has justified the means, I give
you complete freedom to say that I spoke of
Arthur as one might speak of a cook when one's
name had been furnished as a reference.  I gave
him a character&mdash;for his next employer.  No,
indeed, he was not what the young woman could
fairly call a "fusser", but all men of his age
had contracted certain habits.  He abominated
untidiness and unpunctuality&mdash;the necessary
fruit of his business-training; though generous,
he had long been compelled to be <i>careful</i> about
money.  I offered to shew her my books, but
she said she didn't think she could understand
them.  And so on and so forth.  He was very
particular about his food, and in this respect
Mrs. Templedown would have to be a veritable
martinet&mdash;not only to the servants but
to him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lady," I said, "you know
what men of that age are like&mdash;or perhaps you
still don't.  My husband is essentially temperate,
but he is also criminally injudicious.  He
thinks that an occasional glass of champagne&mdash;he
cannot afford to drink it regularly&mdash;is good
for him; <i>I know better</i>.  Acidity...  Whisky
and soda&mdash;two, if he likes&mdash;, one glass of port
and nothing else.  The moment he takes liberties
with himself, his digestion suffers, he cannot
sleep&mdash;and <i>you</i> pay the penalty.  Similarly with
what he eats; he must never be given butcher's
meat more than once a day, shell-fish of every
kind are poison to him, and, though he will
never admit it, any rich sweets tell their tale
next day.  I could give you a list, but you will
find out for yourself...  Smoking again ... one
cigar does him no harm, after two he can
hardly breathe; all the Spenworths are liable to
bronchitis.  And exercise.  My husband was
quite an athlete as a young man; he says he
doesn't need exercise, but <i>I know better</i>.  If I
may speak quite openly, he suffers from what
men call 'liver.' ... I should dearly like to
give you a little list of things, if you won't
think me impertinent; one does not live with
a man for more than thirty years without coming
to regard him as one's child..."
</p>

<p>
And, whether she liked it or not, then and
there, I took pencil and paper and just jotted
things down.  He would never put on his winter
underclothes unless some one reminded him;
result&mdash;a week in bed with a severe chill...
</p>

<p>
"You make him out to be a complete crock,"
said Mrs. Templedown.  Poor soul! one hardly
looked for any great <i>elegance</i> from her...
</p>

<p>
"Not that, by any means," I told her, "but,
at his age, a man has to be careful."
</p>

<p>
We were still at work on the list when her
maid came in and whispered that she had to
dress and be out to dinner in half an hour.  She
was, I understand, going to a dance.
</p>

<p>
"Not with Arthur!" I said.
</p>

<p>
Oh no!  She was going with some friend of
her husband.  I told her that, if Arthur was
ever persuaded or even allowed to stay up after
midnight, one paid for it next day...  She asked
if I would not wait with her while she dressed,
but I was glad to escape while the maid was
still in the room.  The parting, had we been
by ourselves, must inevitably have been difficult.
As it was, we just shook hands...
</p>

<p>
I honestly cannot tell you whether I expected
to hear anything more.  I did not know what
to think and was trying to keep my mind a
blank...  She came next day, when Arthur
was out; it was pleasant to feel that she knew
more of his movements than I did!  We&mdash;my
maid and I&mdash;were upstairs, looking through
Arthur's clothes before packing them to go
abroad with him.  I sent the maid out of the
room and asked if Mrs. Templedown would
mind coming up to me.  And, when she came,
I added practice to theory.  Until you <i>do</i> it,
you're hardly conscious of it; but you cannot
be a man's wife for thirty-two years without
finding out thirty-two <i>thousand</i> little peculiarities
about him.  I had spoken about the winter
underclothing already...  I gave her the
prescription for his tonic and told her where to have
it made up and when he must be <i>forced</i> to take
it&mdash;the symptoms, danger-signals...  My dear,
I talk <i>frankly</i> to you and I sometimes fear that
you must think me terribly sordid, but truly
honestly, if one neglects small things, one
neglects everything.  You may fancy that there
is little difference between two shillings and
half-a-crown on a bottle of medicine, but, when
you take the medicine for half the year and
multiply the difference by twenty-six,&mdash;thirteen
shillings!  Multiply that one item of medicine
by half a hundred things...  I am not very
enthusiastically supported; at dinner it is always
"Why don't we ever have this or that?," when
this or that is out of season and <i>prohibitive</i>;
even Will rounded on me once and said that his
poor old mother had reduced <i>meanness</i> to a fine
art.  I had to bite my lip!  From <i>Will</i>...  I
told poor little Mrs. Templedown everything;
and, if you say that I failed in loyalty to Arthur,
I can only answer that the end must justify the
means and that I am content to be judged by
results.
</p>

<p>
"And now," I said, "I can only wish you
good luck.  I am nothing to you, but, if you
ever feel kindly disposed to a dull old woman,
do your best for Arthur, keep him happy&mdash;for
my sake.  You are making a great experiment
and taking a great risk; you, and you alone,
can crown it with success.  When you both ask
me to divorce my husband, I shall take the
necessary steps; but I shall do nothing hastily.
Perhaps, when you have been with him for a
time, you will find that the difficulties are
greater than you anticipated&mdash;or, let me say,
that success is harder of achievement than you
hoped.  I ask only one thing: do not force
yourselves into an extremity from any false
pride.  Be candid with me, as I have been
candid with you.  Should you find only <i>failure</i>
and the <i>prospect</i> of failure, recognize it boldly.
Write to me.  Say 'It has not turned out as
we expected.  Your husband is coming back
to you.'  I shall receive him without reproaches,
I shall know nothing.  He will find his favourite
dinner, his chair and cigar, his book and 'night-cap',
as he calls it...  I shall be truly glad
to see him back, but I look at you, with all your
youth and beauty; I know that I must not keep
him if you are his hope of happiness.  Kiss me,
dear child," I said, "and do better for him than
I have been able to do."
</p>

<p>
A singular meeting!  She stayed with me
for nearly two hours longer.  I won't say "not
speaking a word", but I can say "not finishing
a sentence."  Bewildered...  Then she went
away, and I rang for my maid.  I never heard
from her again.  On Thursday&mdash;<i>the</i> Thursday&mdash;Arthur
found his suit-case and kit-bag packed
and labelled in the hall.  "I don't want all
this," he said, "for one night." ... And he
was back again in three days.  I <i>happen</i> to
know that he went alone and returned
alone&mdash;and was alone in Paris...
</p>

<p>
I was talking about the diary, was I not?
It is not cheerful reading, and much of it is
dull.  This entry in question: "<i>Arthur returned
from France tired and depressed, but very glad
to be home again...</i>"  It does not mean
much...
</p>

<p>
To any one else...
</p>

<p>
I am not crying!  I am simply <i>worn-out</i>...!
Oh, my dear, I am too old for this
kind of thing, apart from the long agony of
humiliation.  Arthur must send me <i>right</i> away
for a <i>complete</i> change.  He <i>can</i> afford it now...

IX
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH NARRATES AN EMBARRASSMENT AVERTED
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
When do I start, indeed?  My dear, you are
not very complimentary!  We have been back
nearly a week.  <i>That</i> shews how you have
deserted me! ... No, I never intended to be
away for more than about a fortnight.  You
see, so long as this wild beast is at large,
prowling about Morecambe and preparing to spring
at any moment, I <i>dare</i> not leave Will unprotected.
I really don't think I can add anything
to what I've already told you; my boy himself
is so very uncommunicative, and Arthur becomes
alternately violent and morose when I beg
in the <i>humblest</i> way for the <i>least</i> enlightenment.
My reading of the position is that this
"Molly Wanton" set her cap at Will and,
when he refused to have anything to do with
her, <i>rounded</i> on him until he threw up a first-rate
appointment rather than stay another hour
in Morecambe; then she <i>stuffed</i> her foolish
father with lies until the man comes to this
house like a demented creature and vows that
my boy promised to <i>marry</i> his Molly.
</p>

<p>
Indeed I know what I am talking about.
In this very room, though Arthur would not
allow me to be present: it was not "a woman's
province."  Clergyman or no, the mad old
father would have had short shrift from <i>me</i>.
"Proof, my good man," I would have said,
"proof." ... That is how the matter stands
at present, and you can realize that, while
we are braced to receive the next onslaught,
there can be no question of long, careless
holidays.
</p>

<p>
But I was glad I went even for a short time.
Even to Menton, which truly honestly is only
a suburb of Monte Carlo (I had a reason), even
with the railways in their present abominable
condition&mdash;the French seem to be making no
<i>effort</i> to pull themselves together after the war
except by means of wholesale robbery.  They
have clearly decided that, as we came to their
rescue and paid for their war, it is now our
bounden duty to pay for them in peace as well...
I always believe in going <i>right</i> away after
a domestic crisis of that kind; and I was really
beginning to fear a break-down if I stayed any
longer in London.  There is a curious convention
that there is something <i>funny</i> about a man
of Arthur's age and position falling under the
spell of a little chorus-girl; it is less funny when
you have to fight for your life to preserve <i>your</i>
husband and the father of <i>your</i> child.  Some
form of madness that overtakes men...  I have
not told you, I never <i>shall</i> tell you what Arthur
was like when he found that this girl had thrown
him over at the last moment.  Dazed...  His
behaviour to <i>me</i> seemed of <i>no</i> account; the fact
that I knew everything from the girl's own lips
and had helped to pack the clothes in which
he was to run away with her...  He was like
a man in a trance...
</p>

<p>
I uttered no word of reproach.  It was
unnecessary.  At first he behaved as if the light
had gone out of his life&mdash;which was pleasant for
me; then he seemed to realize that perhaps some
amends were owing to me...  Assented
immediately to my proposal that we should go right
away...
</p>

<p>
I chose Menton because Sir Appleton Deepe
was there.  He, I fancy, would be the first to
tell you that I really <i>made</i> him.  Unheard-of
before the war, except in business...  I wanted
his advice about Will: where he could lay out
his talents to greatest advantage, as it were;
and, though nothing has been decided definitely,
I <i>have</i> a promise, and he is most anxious to
meet Will...  So one's time was not <i>wasted</i>...
</p>

<p>
And there, in the peace and wonderful
sunshine, one had an opportunity of recovering
one's perspective.  I had tided Arthur through
his great crisis; and there was nothing, I felt,
to fear in the future.  But we could not let it
rest at that.  There had been an intolerable
amount of malicious gossip&mdash;how wide-spread I
could not believe until the proof was thrust
before me&mdash;; men jesting in their clubs, women
gloating...  And you may be sure that the
Brackenbury and Spenworth broods were only
too delighted to think that yet another had been
dragged down to their level; if one was not to
be a by-word and an object of scorn...
Goodness me, I wasn't thinking of my own poor
dignity, but these stories had to be stopped
somehow.  In the school in which I was brought
up one was supposed to set something of an
example; for what it may be worth, one <i>does</i>
occupy a certain <i>niche</i>; it was more than time
for us to shew that there had <i>been</i> no catastrophe,
as our kind friends would have liked to
think.
</p>

<p>
"Arthur," I said, "you will never hear me
allude to this again.  We have passed through
a time of trouble, but God has mercifully
brought us into safety.  For some months
we have been spied on and whispered about;
it is our duty to shew a happy and united
front!"
</p>

<p>
Arthur said at once that he would do whatever
I wanted...
</p>

<p>
You do not often hear me talking of
"position" or "dignity" or "rights", but I
did indeed feel that any poor little <i>niche</i> we
might occupy was threatened.  Spenworth's
own record is so infamous that people would
feel it was only natural for his brother to tread
the same path.  I am not ashamed to confess
that I <i>do</i> feel what people say about me.  <i>Some</i>
people...  And it was these people, the people
who <i>mattered</i>, that I wanted to convince; if
there was indeed no rift between Arthur and
me, why should we allow the gossips to pretend
there was? ...
</p>

<p>
I decided to signalize our return to England
by a little party&mdash;just a few friends to dinner,
a little music, a few more friends coming in if
they had nothing better to do.  I have never
found it necessary to inform the world&mdash;as your
Mrs. Tom Noddys do&mdash;that they have left
Gloucester Place for Eastbourne or Eastbourne
for Gloucester Place.  Goodness me, "Who
wonders&mdash;and who cares?," as they say.  But
I was not sorry to find that our little party was
being discussed; and, of course, when once the
princess's name was mentioned, the papers
came at me with open arms...  I left no stone
unturned to make a success of the little
gathering.  We have always been quite pitiably
restricted in our entertaining, but this was not
the moment to grudge a few extra pounds well
laid-out...  And it does not require a
mathematician to prove that Arthur could have given
me more money if he had given less in other
directions.  Of course, I did not <i>hint</i> such a
thing; my dear, <i>peace</i>, <i>forgiveness</i>,
<i>forgetfulness</i> was what I wanted...  And it
was not necessary; Arthur assented to
everything.
</p>

<p>
First of all I made certain of the princess.
What she can see in a dull old woman like me
you must ask <i>her</i>; but she has been a <i>true</i> and
<i>loving</i> friend for perhaps more years than either
of us now cares to recall; and, if humble affection
and gratitude matter to her, she knows that they
are hers whenever she does me the honour of
visiting my house...  She likes coming, I know;
in me, she has been gracious enough to say, she
finds an attitude of mind, a point of view which
is disappearing only too fast; in a sense&mdash;I am
sure she would be the first to excuse my
presumption&mdash;we were brought up in the same
school.
</p>

<p>
There was no difficulty about securing my
brother.  It is a pose with Brackenbury to
pretend that he hates what he calls
"orders-and-decorations" parties,
but my sister-in-law is not
so jaded.  Perhaps in the world in which she was
reared...  I certainly notice marked civility and
almost affection if Ruth hears that I am giving
a party and that the princess has graciously
consented to be present.  My niece Phyllida is
less punctilious in her courtesy; there is rather
too much of the "Oh-I-don't-care-<i>what</i>-I-do"
attitude about her, and, since she found that her
cabman hero was still alive and somewhere in
London...  A curious recklessness and restlessness...
I invited her because I cannot bear to
see a girl&mdash;young, well-connected, rich,
good-looking&mdash;simply <i>moping</i>...  They say it takes
two to make a quarrel, and I have refused to
quarrel with Phyllida, so that at last I think she
has ceased to believe that I turned the cabman
hero against her in the hope of keeping her
for my boy.  I&mdash;have&mdash;not&mdash;lifted&mdash;a&mdash;<i>finger</i>!
She evidently enjoys being with Will; and, if
he wanted to marry her, I should not stand in
the way.  Ever since that Morecambe nightmare
began, I have felt that I shall never
know a moment's peace until he is safely
married...
</p>

<p>
I don't <i>want</i> him to go abroad...  When
any one in his position seeks his fortune in a
foreign country, there is always a tendency
among some people to ask what he has <i>done</i>, to
treat him as a remittance-man ... which is
offensive without being particularly amusing...
I have lost the thread...
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes!  My little party.  One thing I
noticed on returning to England was the
extraordinary mixture of people that one met
everywhere.  For this, though I am personally fond
of her, I blame Connie Maitland more than any
dozen other women.  Not being a <i>persona grata</i>
in certain circles to which she would dearly
like to have the <i>entrée</i>, she seems to cultivate
numbers for their own sake.  When the princess...
More by a hint, you understand, than by
any direct criticism...  But she cannot help
seeing that the old barriers <i>have</i> been broken
down...  It is always on the tip of my tongue
to make my Lady Maitland wholly responsible.
During the war one was <i>flung</i> against these
people, as it were: the strangest generals who
seemed to have been stock-brokers the moment
before...  All that sort of thing...  "Captains
of Industry" (I believe they are called) with
the queerest accents and all holding high office.
There was an <i>epidemic</i> of cabinet rank; and,
if one had business in Whitehall, one met the
oddest people&mdash;never the same two days
running.  Connie Maitland <i>thoroughly</i> enjoyed
herself, I always felt; so many new people to
know before any one else.  (I am not ashamed
to confess that it is <i>not</i> my ambition simply to
know new people.)  When I returned from
Menton, I did drop a little hint and suggest
that, as the war was now over, she ought to
revise some of her war friendships.  Quite
kindly and gradually, you understand; I know
that with some of the really estimable women
who sat on committees with me...  "<i>Is</i> it
true kindness?," I asked myself.  "They lead
their lives, you lead yours; the war brought
you together, but you've <i>nothing</i> else in
common..."  After that breath of fresh air at
Menton, I was honestly truly aghast to find what
London had become without one's noticing it.
I sought an opportunity of speaking to the
princess about it: I felt some one ought to
make a little stand.  <i>I</i> don't count, because I'm
not in a position to entertain; but I did resolve
to confine my little party <i>simply</i> to the old
friends...
</p>

<p>
I invited Spenworth...  You look surprised;
but, if you will think for a moment...  Arthur's
brother.  It was notorious that I had for years
disapproved of his whole way of life, but the
family had to shew a united front.  His <i>very</i>
recent divorce, which&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;I
think was forgiven far too quickly; goodness
me, I hope I am not a bigot and I would
assuredly persecute no one, but "whom God
hath joined together" ... I invited him chiefly
on his wife's account; her position is not so
secure that she can altogether dispense with a
supporting hand, and I was tired of confessing
to people that I had not even met her...  Never
can I forget, either, Spenworth's triumph when
for a moment Arthur seemed to be treading his
path...  <i>My</i> Nemesis for trying to hold my head
erect and daring to reprove him.  No, I did not
hear what he said, but I am certain that he
said it...
</p>

<p>
For several days&mdash;to my amazement, for I
knew they were at Cheniston&mdash;there was no
reply.  Then I met Spenworth in the street.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!," he began.  (You know that
<i>hunting-field</i> voice of his?)  "You aren't
playing the game with poor old Arthur, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I must beg for enlightenment,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, you know, this is the first time
the poor old boy has ever left the rails."  (I
am always lost in admiration of Spenworth's
<i>elegance</i>!)  "Dust his jacket for him at home
as much as you like, but don't make him eat
humble-pie in public, don't make an exhibition
of him."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you <i>mean</i>," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bunkum!  Every one knows he tried
to slip his collar, every one thought he'd got
away; and, now that you've recaptured him,
you want to shew him off in his muzzle.
'Tain't cricket, Ann, if you ask me; you've
won, and there's no need to crow over the old
boy.  'Tain't as if he'd given you any trouble
before."
</p>

<p>
"I must give it up," I said in despair.
"Spenworth, will you tell me&mdash;in language
comprehensible to my poor wits&mdash;whether you
and your wife are coming to dine on the
eighteenth?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much, Ann," he answered,
"we are <i>not</i>.  'Matter o' fact, I'm taking the
chair at a regimental dinner, but if I <i>wasn't</i>...
I think it's an infernal shame and I hope it's
a rotten party."
</p>

<p>
And then he turned on his heel...
</p>

<p>
I can never see his charm, myself.  People
excuse his rudeness, his immorality, his utterly
wasted, self-indulgent life...  They say he's
"such a good fellow", whatever that may
mean...  But I find it very hard to speak <i>coolly</i>
about Spenworth...
</p>

<p>
Without wanting to be inhospitable, I was
secretly <i>relieved</i> that he could not come.  The
dear princess is the soul of tolerance, but I was
not at all sure how she would receive his name;
I was not at all sure that he would even behave
himself properly.  Did I ever tell you how he
set himself to drive the Archbishop out of the
house by sheer&mdash;but I prefer not to discuss it.
"Indecency" is really the only word; under
the guise of an ethical discussion...  As we
literally cannot sit down more than twenty-four
in Mount Street, two spare places <i>are</i> a
consideration.  I was fortunate enough to secure
the Duke and Duchess of Yarrow; one had not
seen much of them for some years, and the
duchess is so deaf that I sometimes wonder
whether she is really quite right in her head,
but the duke is a director of the Far East
Trading Company, and I thought that, if Will
ever <i>did</i> think of going abroad to seek his
fortune, the duke ought to know of it before
he was snapped up by any one else.  The
others...  But I expect you saw the list; it was
in all the papers&mdash;the Bishop of Hatwell, dear
old Lady Ursula Bedmont, the Minister of
Fine Arts, the Spanish Ambassador...
</p>

<p>
Or was it the Italian?  I'm quite stupid
about remembering who was there.  It was so
long since I'd given a party of any kind that
I'm not ashamed to confess I was a little
nervous.  And we began badly: Lord Fenchurch,
who <i>really</i> grows more and more absent-minded
every day, arrived with a black tie and
one of those detestable little jackets that young
men affect in theatres.  Arthur was waiting in
the hall to receive the princess and in a
<i>moment</i> had him fitted out properly, while a
maid dashed to Hay Hill to fetch his
St. George.  (As Arthur said, "We can lend you
anything from the South African medal to
the Victorian Order, but we <i>don't</i> fly as high
as Garters.")
</p>

<p>
One or two <i>tiny</i> hitches like that, just
enough to make me nervous...  When the
princess arrived, all was transformed: she was
more than gracious, wanting to know why she
never saw anything of me nowadays...  Some
people are quite wonderfully able to give you
that sense of <i>well-being</i>.  I presented Will.
She said:
</p>

<p>
"But <i>you're</i> not old enough to have a
grown-up son!"
</p>

<p>
"I am old enough to be <i>proud</i> of it,
ma'am," I said.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I am <i>envious</i>; but, when I saw
the success of my little party, when I looked at
Brackenbury, who <i>has</i> the money and does
nothing with it, <i>and</i> at Ruth, who couldn't do
anything with it if she wanted to ...  just an
over-grown school-girl...  When I thought of
Spenworth and the <i>opportunities</i> at Cheniston,
I felt it was a little hard...  They do come to
me, gladly, graciously; and I am not in a
position to entertain them...
</p>

<p>
After dinner we had music...
</p>

<p>
I don't know what your experience has been,
but I find it hard to remain patient with the
whole world of people who delight in calling
themselves "artists".  (If English has any
meaning, an artist is a person who <i>paints</i>, not
a fiddler or a poet or an actor.)  So much fuss
has been made of them that their heads have
really been turned.  Before I had quite decided
what music to have, I heard a young man playing
at Connie Maitland's.  Quite well he played&mdash;for
an Englishman, and I asked Connie to
present him.
</p>

<p>
"I have a few friends dining on the
eighteenth," I said, "and I was wondering
whether you would be so very kind as to come
and give us an opportunity of hearing a little
more of your too delightful playing."
</p>

<p>
These people <i>expect</i> to be flattered, as no
doubt you know...
</p>

<p>
"The eighteenth?," he repeated.  "I'm
not dining anywhere that night, so far as I
know; I will come with great pleasure."
</p>

<p>
The impudence of the man!
</p>

<p>
"Dinner itself..." I said.  "My dining-room
is so absurdly small that I am absolutely
restricted in numbers.  But <i>afterwards</i>...  I
have asked a few friends, real music-lovers; say
about half-past ten.  The address&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he interrupted, "I'll ask you to get
in touch with my agent.  He'll tell you my
terms and make all arrangements."
</p>

<p>
"But there are no arrangements to make,"
I protested.  "Lady Maitland told me that you
were a new-comer to London, and I thought
you might like to meet a few people..."
</p>

<p>
And then I told him that the princess had
graciously promised to come.
</p>

<p>
The young man thought it over&mdash;for all the
world as though he were at a bazaar and I were
pressing him to buy something that he didn't
want!  I was <i>beside</i> myself...
</p>

<p>
"I should like to meet her," he was good
enough to say.  "She may be useful.  All
right, I'll do it this once."
</p>

<p>
And, do you know, it was on the tip of my
tongue to say that never should he set foot
inside my <i>house</i>!  First of all <i>inviting</i> himself
to dinner, then trying to make me <i>pay</i> him for
coming...  An artist I can understand; and
a tradesman I can understand.  But this
hybrid...
</p>

<p>
And on the night he insisted on my presenting
him to the princess.  Insisted!  There is
no other word...  She, of course, was too
sweet ... made no objection and even
complimented him.  I kept thinking of the old
days.  When my niece Phyllida came out just
before the war, Brackenbury gave a ball for her
and asked me to do what I could (Ruth is worse
than useless on such occasions, because she tries
to cover up her ignorance by saying it doesn't
matter&mdash;and being obstinate about it).  I
ordered the band&mdash;from those really nice people
in Clifford Street&mdash;; and the princess was
present on that occasion too.  I <i>wondered</i> what
we should have thought if the leader had strolled
up, baton in hand, and said: "Oh, won't you
present me to Her Royal Highness?" ...
</p>

<p>
I <i>will</i> say this boy played well.  Magnetically...
The whole room was silent and motionless.
One looked up through a mist, as it were,
and saw rows of rapt faces, a regiment of men
by the walls, a mere black and white cloud by
the door.
</p>

<p>
At first I did not notice...
</p>

<p>
I mean, one cannot be expected to identify
eighty or a hundred people all at once; the
princess was obviously my first concern, and,
when this young fellow ceased playing and I
stood up, <i>naturally</i> I imagined that they would
all come forward.  So they did ... some of
them.  I am not good at recognizing people, so
I made allowances for myself; but, even so, a
<i>great</i> many of the faces were unfamiliar.
Nothing in that, you may say; a little music
and some light refreshments&mdash;sandwiches and
cake, you know, with perhaps claret-cup and
coffee&mdash;afford a wonderful opportunity for
making a little return to people whom one
truly honestly doesn't want to have <i>dining</i>;
I'm sure you understand!  There is nothing
wrong with them or I would not invite them
to have the honour of meeting the princess; but,
as Will would say, they just don't pull their
weight in the boat...  I recognized one or two
... and then, really, I did not know what to
make of it.  After anything I may have said to
the princess about the unpleasantly go-as-you-please,
enjoy-yourself-and-don't-ask-questions
character of modern London, you may be sure
that I had not encouraged anybody to collect
the first half-dozen waifs and strays from the
street and bring them in.  Every one had been
<i>told</i> that the princess would be there, so that
they might equip themselves accordingly; yet,
when I looked round the room, I did not know
a tenth of the people!
</p>

<p>
It was like a bad dream!  You know my
drawing-room in Mount Street: windows on
the south side, and between them a sofa on
which I was sitting with the princess; to the
left, at the far end, the piano; to the right,
the door.  At one moment&mdash;a perfect picture!
Dear old Lord Fenchurch with his St. George,
Brackenbury with the Bath, my boy with his
war medals&mdash;almost every one with a little
<i>something</i> to enhance what will always be the
most <i>dignified</i> dress in the world.  Repose...
Distinction.  And then, at the door, an
invading army!  Men I had never seen before, some
in uniform, some in those detestable little
jackets and limp, pleated shirts; flushed,
dishevelled...  And all of them unknown to me
as the man in the moon!  The princess, perhaps
you know, abominates the smell of tobacco;
need I say that a positive <i>cloud</i> of smoke was
bursting in from the stair-case? ...
</p>

<p>
If it had been the men alone, I could have
borne it.  <i>Somehow</i> one would have carried it
off...  I made my way, through this <i>sea</i> of
strange faces, to the door&mdash;and I really believe
that, if I had found the Jacquerie in possession,
I could hardly have been more astounded.  <i>With</i>
the men there were girls, scores and scores of
them, surging up to the door, lolling about on
the stairs, smoking cigarettes in the hall,
powdering their horrible little noses.  One
glance was enough...  The dresses alone&mdash;skirts
that hardly reached their <i>knees</i>, bodices
that hardly reached their <i>waists</i>, "the shoe and
shoulder-strap brigade", as my boy calls them.
A reek of powder and cheap scent...
</p>

<p>
"What," I said, "what have I done to deserve this?"
</p>

<p>
You would think that my cross was
sufficiently heavy, but I was evidently to be
spared nothing.  <i>Some of the men were not
even sober</i>!  As I came on to the landing, some
one said&mdash;with great elegance&mdash;:
</p>

<p>
"Here, old thing, you'd better go home
and sleep it off."
</p>

<p>
Don't let me claim more pity than I
deserve!  I <i>was</i> spared a free fight.  When the
Arbiter of Taste had returned from escorting
his friend downstairs, I said to him:
</p>

<p>
"I must <i>beg</i> for enlightenment.  There has
evidently been a mistake.  I cannot remember
having invited you; and I think you must have
come to the wrong house."
</p>

<p>
He looked a little surprised, but rallied at
once and pulled from his pocket a <i>menu</i> with
the address written on it.
</p>

<p>
"We were told that you were giving a
dance and that we might come," he said.  "I
am addressing Lady Ann Spenworth, am I
not?"
</p>

<p>
"You are," I said, "but there's some
hideous mistake.  Dance?  There's no dance.
<i>Who</i> told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord Spenworth," he answered.  "At the
regimental dinner.  He said that you were
giving a party; some of us were a bit shy of
coming without an invitation, but he assured us
that we should be as welcome as he was.  We'd
all arranged to go on to Ledlow's; so, as soon
as we'd found our partners, on we came.  Is it
the wrong night?"
</p>

<p>
"Wrong night!," I said.  "All nights are
wrong nights!  My brother-in-law must have
made a mistake.  I <i>am</i> giving a little party and
I invited him..."
</p>

<p>
And then I whispered to this boy about the
princess.  I must say that he behaved <i>well</i>.  It
can never be pleasant to find yourself in a house
where you're not expected and where, only too
plainly, you're not wanted.  He saw my terrible
position...
</p>

<p>
"I hope you realize it's not <i>our</i> fault," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"I acquit you of <i>everything</i>," I cried.
"But won't you explain to your friends
and&mdash;and get them away?"
</p>

<p>
He promised to do his best, though some of
the men looked anything but tractable; and I
went back to the princess, hoping that the
music would <i>drown</i> all the going and coming.
"Play like mad!," I whispered to this boy at
the piano; "<i>Noise</i>, at all costs!"  And, as if
I hadn't enough to bear, I thought he was
going to take offence.  Half-way through, the
door opened a crack, and I saw&mdash;who do you
think?  Colonel Butler; Phyllida's cabman
hero.  Nothing could surprise me then&mdash;the
fact that he was in evening-dress...  If he'd
brought his cab in with him...
</p>

<p>
I hurried to the door, no longer caring
whether he met Phyllida, whether she threw
herself at his head...  <i>Any</i>thing...
</p>

<p>
"This is a case for heroic measures, Lady
Ann," he said, when I had explained my <i>tragic</i>
position.  "Some of these fellows have been
doing themselves rather well and they swear
they won't go without a dance.  If you leave
things to me, I believe I can pull you through.
Certainly I'll do my best, but you must back
me up in everything.  Is that agreed?  Then,
as soon as the music stops, will you present
me to the princess?  I'll get hold of your
husband and Will and tell them what has to
be done."
</p>

<p>
I asked leave to present him...  The
princess knew his name, knew all about him&mdash;far
more than I had ever guessed.  It appears
that he ought to have had the V.C.; and, if
it lay in my gift, he should have had it that
night!  Oh, I don't wonder that he did well
in the war.  Such coolness, determination,
foresight...
</p>

<p>
"I expect Lady Ann has told you, ma'am,"
he began, "that the Forest Rangers have been
having their regimental dinner.  Lady Ann
has <i>most</i> kindly lent us the house for a little
dance later on.  I want to know whether I
may ask an extraordinary favour.  It will give
immense gratification if you will allow Lady
Ann to present the officers to you before the
dance begins.  I know it's a very big thing to
ask, because there are a great many of them;
but, if you knew the pleasure you would confer,
I could almost hope that you would forgive
my presumption."
</p>

<p>
The princess is really and truly the sweetest
woman I know.  Was there a moment's hesitation?
Colonel Butler brought them in, one
after another, announced the names, herded
them out again, brought in more.  Arthur
hunted them upstairs to his bedroom as they
came out, so that there should be a little room
on the stairs...  And, when she came out&mdash;this
presentation was really a very clever stroke
on Colonel Butler's part to give her an excuse
for leaving&mdash;, there was a word and a smile for
every one&mdash;praising the girls' dresses, saying
she hoped that all the young people would have
a <i>very</i> pleasant time.  Graciousness like that
cannot be <i>learned</i>, but perhaps a certain dignity
can.  To do these girls justice, they behaved
quite admirably; no familiarity, no nervousness&mdash;to
the outward eye.  I hope for their sakes
that, when they compared their own "shoes
and shoulder-straps" with what was thought
fitting to be worn by another generation,
trained in a different school, the lesson was not
altogether thrown away...
</p>

<p>
I did not suppose that Colonel Butler
<i>seriously</i> intended that I should improvize a
dance at a moment's notice, but I had
misjudged my man.  He had given his word, he
said, and, if he broke it, there might be an
unpleasant scene; if, however, I would back
him up, he would "see me through" again.
Almost before the princess was out of the
house, one section was rolling back the rug in
the drawing-room and disposing of the furniture.
Arthur, with his coat off and his shirt-sleeves
rolled up, was dashing down to the cellar and
up again, bringing wine that literally cannot
be replaced; and, to judge from next day's
accounts, it must have been Colonel Butler
himself who won over my rather unyielding cook.
He has a gift of <i>silver</i> speech; the superior
young man at the piano, who always left
all arrangements of terms to his <i>agent</i>, if
you please, sat with a bottle of champagne
and a plate of sandwiches playing till <i>four
o'clock</i>...
</p>

<p>
The relief was so great that I really quite
lost my head.  Colonel Butler asked me for the
first dance&mdash;quite charmingly.
</p>

<p>
"Your manners are better than your judgement
of age," I said.  "I have not danced for
thirty years."
</p>

<p>
"But it's quite simple," he explained.
"Walk round the room in time with the music,
turn when you feel inclined and add any frills
you like when we've got into each other's
step."
</p>

<p>
And I <i>did</i>...
</p>

<p>
Jean Yarrow I found later, helping him to
cut sandwiches and bawling the most unsuitable
answers to questions which, poor soul, she could
not hear.  When he said something about
"potted tongue", she thought he said "clot
in the lung" and gave him a history of her own
complaints which I could not help feeling was
<i>not</i> suitable for the ears of a young man...
The duke, meanwhile, was mixing cup by some
secret process that he had learned at Cambridge;
I hoped it would save the wine a little, but
from this point of view it was <i>not</i> a success.
They only asked for more, like that boy in the
book...
</p>

<p>
To use a favourite word of Will's, Colonel
Butler was a "superman."  But for him...  I
mean, there was plenty of high spirits but not
a hint of rowdiness.  And he was master of the
ceremonies, cook, butler, carriage-finder.  The
older generation, too, has been so much thrust
into the background that we find it refreshing
when a young man shews a little politeness and
consideration.  As soon as supper was ready&mdash;he
had prepared it with his own hands&mdash;,
Colonel Butler asked if he might take me
down.  Arthur was with me and he at once
intervened.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he said.  "You're a dancing
man.  Go off and find Phyllida.  You'll spoil
her evening if you don't ask her to dance."
</p>

<p>
I should have thought it was hardly necessary
to <i>throw</i> the girl at him like that, but after the
way Brackenbury and Ruth had been crying
over their lost sheep...
</p>

<p>
"It's no use your thinking you can keep her
for Will," Arthur said, though I had never
uttered a word.  "Look at them&mdash;meeting...
And now look at them&mdash;dancing.  Come down
to supper."
</p>

<p>
I don't think that any account of the dance
was published in the press.  I certainly supplied
no particulars.  But I expect you read about
the dinner.  I have been inundated with letters
of thanks&mdash;the most touching, unquestionably,
from the princess, who loved what she called
my little informal gathering.  It was not
quite what I had intended, but the <i>effect</i> was
good; when our friends saw us together&mdash;I
mean Arthur and me, of course&mdash;harmoniously,
lovingly...
</p>

<p>
As regards Phyllida and Colonel Butler, you
know as much as I do...  There has been no
announcement; and, if people do not wish to
tell me things, I do not choose to ask...
</p>

<p>
From every point of view&mdash;almost, the
evening was highly successful.
</p>

<p>
But I shall never forgive Spenworth, never...
As long as I live...

<h3>
X
<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH IS A PRISONER IN HER OWN HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
You must forgive me for making you wait like
this.  The servants have positive instructions
to say that I am not at home to any one until
I have been specifically asked.  Why one should
be at the mercy of anybody who chooses to burst
in...  When all is said and done, the Englishman's
home is still his castle.
</p>

<p>
Partly I have been busy, partly I have been
very much worried, partly I have been driven
to it in self-defence.  I only wish I had been
more unyielding before.  I told you of the mad
clergyman from Morecambe who swept like a
whirl-wind into this room, demanding to see
my husband and, so far as I can make out,
trying to browbeat my boy into marrying his
daughter...  It began from that day, and I
find it hard to forgive Arthur for not enlightening
me.  With Will it was altogether different;
no man that I should care to meet would try
to get out of a difficulty at the expense of a
woman.  The code forbids that...
</p>

<p>
But, if Arthur&mdash;who <i>knew</i> as soon as there
was anything to know&mdash;had told me, I should
have acted at <i>once</i>; we should not be in our
present state of absolute uncertainty, simply
waiting with folded hands for the next blow to
fall...  Men have a strange idea that certain
things are exclusively their <i>province</i>; their wives,
even the mothers of their children must remain
outside the door until it is too late to repair
the damage.  I was not told the <i>facts</i> until two
days ago...
</p>

<p>
When my boy was offered that position at
Morecambe, I went with him to see that he had
a place fit to live in.  The Phentons seemed our
best hope, they were highly recommended, and
I will say ungrudgingly that they played their
cards well.  An elderly clergyman, who had
resigned his benefice on account of ill-health, a
decent motherly woman for wife&mdash;and these two
girls, young, presentable and thoroughly <i>nice</i>...
If you tell me that I am too unready to think
ill of people, I have no defence&mdash;except to say
that I am not prepared to go through life
<i>suspecting</i>...  Molly Phenton was very much "the
old country parson's pretty little daughter";
simple, innocent, shy; a little fluttered, you
would say, when she heard who we were, and
agreeably excited by the prospect of having a
good-looking young man to stay in the house...
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she <i>overdid</i> the innocence.  Eyes are
eyes, and saucers are saucers...  But I don't
wish to appear wise after the event.  I was
completely taken in...
</p>

<p>
And so was Will.  She was clever enough to
guess that this was the appeal to reach him
quickest: the simple little girl with the soft hair
and the big grey eyes, living out of the world
with her old father, no brothers to protect her
or <i>teach</i> her anything.  One would never have
been surprised to find her affecting a lisp...
She deliberately laid herself out to catch my boy.
</p>

<p>
You must not ask me what happened.  I
have never been forced to study the methods
of campaign which a woman adopts for such a
purpose.  No doubt she tried first of all to
attract him innocently.  Whatever success she
had, poor Will is not free to marry where his
heart leads him, unless his heart leads him where
there is <i>some</i> money (I have always, as you
know, dreaded an entanglement with some girl
whom he would <i>simply</i> have to support all his
life); and Will is too honourable to give any
encouragement to some one he has no intention
of marrying.  You will understand me, too,
when I say that <i>no</i> one could have called it a
very suitable alliance&mdash;for him or for <i>her</i>; it is
no kindness to a girl to transport her from
her own world, though&mdash;poor souls!&mdash;they all
fancy that, if they can achieve a great match,
they will be happy, and the rest will come
by the light of nature.  Goodness me, have we
not seen that tragically disproved with Ruth
Brackenbury and Kathleen Spenworth?  Will
and this girl had <i>nothing</i> in common.  If she
married him, it would be over my dead body...
</p>

<p>
If she did not see this, at least she saw that
she was making no impression on my boy; and
then I am sadly afraid that she deliberately laid
herself out to tempt him.  I have seen enough
of life to know that, when a woman abandons
herself to this kind of thing, very few even of
the purest and best are proof against her <i>wiles</i>.
This Molly had made up her mind to get a hold
on Will; and, once she had decided on that, she
would stop at nothing.
</p>

<p>
I never knew a <i>thing</i> at the time.  When my
boy suddenly arrived in London, when the mad
clergyman followed him and <i>insisted</i> on seeing
Arthur, I thought that she would content
herself with making him compromise her.  If they
could be discovered <i>kissing</i> ... as they <i>were</i>...
And that was all that even her father was
allowed to know at the time, though she talked
about a promise of marriage.  But she was clever
enough to know that she couldn't make a man
marry her because he had kissed her...
</p>

<p>
So far as I can see, there is no doubt at
all...  I did not ask Will, because I could not
bear him to tell me an untruth; and the code
ordains that a man must never admit such a
thing, always the woman must be shielded.  One
did not need to be his mother in order to see
that he was <i>worried</i>.  Remorse...  The sense
that nothing could ever again be the same...
<i>Hatred</i> of himself...  Hatred of <i>her</i>...  And,
all the while, I had to sit with my hands in my
lap, seeing his health and happiness ruined.
He could not eat, he could not <i>sleep</i>; Sir
Appleton kept writing and telephoning to ask when
Will was coming to see him, but there was no
question of trying to find fresh <i>work</i>...  And
at any moment this wild man of the woods
might <i>descend</i> upon us again.
</p>

<p>
The first time he came&mdash;I, if you please,
was not allowed in the room&mdash;, Arthur would
only stamp up and down, saying that Will&mdash;<i>our
boy</i>&mdash;was a scamp and deserved horse-whipping.
I begged for enlightenment, but at
this period the wild man only claimed that Will
had compromised his Molly and that there had
been a promise of marriage...  <i>Exactly</i> what
one would have expected!  <i>Precisely</i> what the
girl was working for!  <i>That</i> was the moment
to strike and to strike hard.  "A promise of
marriage?  <i>Prove</i> it!"  I well knew that Will
was too instinctively wise to write her
letters&mdash;and they were in the same house!&mdash;or to
give her presents.  But I was informed that this
was not a woman's province.  So we dragged
on, waiting for the blow...
</p>

<p>
I quite dreaded the Morecambe post-mark.
The girl wrote every other day, and every letter
seemed to plunge poor Will into deeper gloom.
The code would not let him make a confidant
of his mother, but one day I saw one of these
letters.  It bore no name and opened with a
flood of mingled passion and reproach; only
when I saw "<i>Your heart-broken Molly</i>" at the
end did I realize that the letter was intended for
Will.  She was begging him to come back and
talking a great deal about his "promise"...
I should have paid no attention if there had
not been other things as well: talk about her
"honour" and so on and so forth...  Her
"<i>soul</i>"...  God would never forgive her&mdash;the
egotism of the girl! ... Then I felt that,
to get a <i>hold</i> on Will, she had stopped at
nothing...
</p>

<p>
I wonder what you would have done in my
place? ... Constant dripping wears away a stone,
and this dazing attack would in time have broken
down my boy's resistance.  Suppose he had <i>let</i>
himself be blackmailed into marrying her!  No
money on either side&mdash;and Will's <i>parents</i> could
do nothing to help&mdash;, not a taste in common,
two people drawn from different worlds...
And this terrible, <i>blasting</i> knowledge that
he&mdash;and <i>she</i>&mdash;and <i>I</i> had of the girl's character.
Ruin, misery lay before them.  And <i>nothing</i>
else...
</p>

<p>
I had to save Will from any temptation to
yield.  If he could have fallen in love with
some nice girl and forgotten the whole episode...
If I could have sent him <i>right</i> away...  It
was not easy, and you know better than any
one that my hands have been fairly full.  At
one time I thought that South American woman
was attracted by him, at another my niece
Phyllida roused to interest.  He was so much
preoccupied that he seemed indifferent to
women; one after another, they gave him up
in despair.  Then I bethought me of my second
string and cast about in my mind for means
to send him far away where he could forget this
girl and her importunity...
</p>

<p>
You have met Sir Appleton Deepe in this
house.  You have met him more than once and
you have always been too dear and too discreet
to ask, to hint, to raise an eyebrow in mild
wonder that I should be <i>liée</i> with such a man.
<i>Of his kind</i> I believe he has no rival.  As a
mere boy he was sent out to one of the Chinese
branches of the business; and by sheer hard
work, by studying the natives and learning
their requirements he had, before he was
forty, built up the trade of his firm to its
present gigantic dimensions.  Now he is senior
partner and a millionaire many times over,
with patronage beyond one's wildest dreams.
Curious!  These "merchant princes" are all
the same&mdash;never content to stick to their
business, always looking for fresh worlds to conquer.
I met Sir Appleton&mdash;he was plain Mr. Deepe
then&mdash;in the early days of the war; and, though
any <i>intimacy</i> was out of the question, I felt that
he was a man to keep one's eye on for the days
when the war would be over and all our boys
would be wondering what to do next.  He had
great ideas then of going into politics&mdash;something
that Lady Maitland let fall had started the
train, and he was convinced that the business
man had the world at his feet.  (I could not help
wondering whether she hoped to exploit him on
behalf of that <i>worthless</i> youngest boy of hers,
the one who evaded military service by <i>hiding</i>
in one of the government offices.)
</p>

<p>
"No, Mr. Deepe," I said.  "To use one
of your own phrases, you have missed your
market.  The business men have got in before
you."  And, goodness me, in those days,
Whitehall was like a foreign capital!  Even the
ministers were unheard-of, and every one seemed
to be a mining magnate or a shipping magnate
or a railway magnate or the keeper of a shop...
If one had a favour to ask, one quite literally
did not know whom to approach.  And they
were always changing...  "No, Mr. Deepe,"
I said, "some enter society through politics,
others enter politics through society; but no
man ever rose to the top of the political
tree&mdash;<i>and stayed there</i>&mdash;without <i>backing</i>"...
</p>

<p>
And, so far as I could, I shewed him how
it should be done and who were the people he
must get to know.  <i>Quite</i> methodically I set
him to work; and I really took a great deal of
trouble about him.  Connie Maitland has the
sublime assurance to pretend that <i>she</i> got
him his knighthood, but on a point like
that Sir Appleton himself is surely the most
reliable witness...  I helped him in a hundred
ways; he is quite reasonably well-known
now...
</p>

<p>
When the bomb-shell first descended from
Morecambe, I thought at once of him.  In such
a business there must be scores of openings for
young men of character and ability, accustomed
to command; and, say what you like, the
presence of those whom for want of a better word
I will call "well-connected" <i>does</i> help to lift
commerce out of the ruck...  Unhappily Sir
Appleton was abroad at the time, and that was
really why we chose Menton, which truly
honestly is only a <i>suburb</i> of Monte Carlo.  The
opportunity was too good to be thrown away;
and it was worth enduring a little discomfort if
by shewing him some slight civility I could
enlist his support.  It was not so <i>easy</i> as I had
hoped.  He wanted to make me believe that the
best positions in the business were reserved for
men who had worked their way up from the
bottom, as he had done; that there was an
immense deal to be learned, that the most responsible
part of his duties consisted in choosing the
right men...
</p>

<p>
"But," I said, "I <i>am</i> in a position to speak
with knowledge here; it is my own son whom
I am putting forward."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted to see him," answered
Sir Appleton, "and to talk things over again
on my return to London."
</p>

<p>
And really he wanted to leave it like that,
but I am not <i>quite</i> so easily discouraged.  I
hammered away until I had extracted a definite
promise that he would find <i>some</i> position in
which Will could support himself, though I am
afraid he was not very gracious about it...
</p>

<p>
"If I accept him in the dark," he said in
conclusion, "don't blame me for discharging
him after a month if I find he's no good."
</p>

<p>
"I have no fear of that," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Discharge" was hardly the word I should
have chosen, but one is foolish to expect too
great nicety of language...
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that Sir Appleton should
dine with us here to meet Will.
</p>

<p>
I did <i>try</i> to impress on my boy that this
would be one of the most momentous days of
his life.  I wanted Sir Appleton to see him at
his best.  When you have no experience, no
technical knowledge to offer, it is so important
that character, personality, breeding...  I am
sure you understand what I mean.  And I could
never forget that, when the Jew man&mdash;Sir
Adolf Erckmann or whatever he <i>now</i> calls
himself&mdash;pretended to have an appointment ready
and waiting, Will endangered his prospects by
participating in some ridiculous game that
caused our worthy host to take offence.  One
had not looked for such sensitiveness in <i>that</i>
quarter; but, when a man is uncertain of himself
and takes refuge in his dignity, high spirits
and irresponsibility have no place.  <i>This</i> time,
I told Will, he must run <i>no</i> risks.  And, after
that, I hoped&mdash;<i>and expected</i>&mdash;to see my boy
taking our friend by <i>storm</i>...
</p>

<p>
Do you know, it was as much as I could do
to prevail on him to meet Sir Appleton at all!
This <i>menace</i> was preying on his nerves; this
pitiless hail of appealing letters from his
"heart-broken Molly".  One day he came in looking
as if he had seen a ghost.  This girl had dared
to call for him at his club!  I am thankful to
say that he kept his head and refused resolutely
to see her, but we never imagined that she was
in London...  And we both knew that we
should now never be safe even in our own house.
She had not dared to face <i>me</i>; perhaps she made
a good guess what kind of reception I should
feel it my duty to give her; she was clever
enough to know that a woman would see through
her in a moment...  But she would make for
Will the moment she thought my back was turned...
</p>

<p>
It was then that I gave those orders to the
servants.  There had been one or two cases in
the papers, you may remember, of people who
called on chance and walked off with whatever
they could lay their hands on.  I made this the
text for my little homily.  And it was not a
moment too soon!  The girl called that same
afternoon and asked to see my boy...
</p>

<p>
She called daily, refusing to take "no" for
an answer.  Mr. William Spenworth not at
home?  When <i>would</i> he be home? ... But
for this dinner to Sir Appleton, I should have
insisted on sending Will <i>right</i> away, but I <i>had</i>
to hold my hand until the Chinese appointment
had been arranged.  The servants were
instructed to say that they did not know...
And, after that, I knew it was only a question
of time before she encamped on the pavement
at sunrise and <i>stayed</i> there...  Can you imagine
a more intolerable situation?  Always having
to peep round the curtain to see whether it was
safe to <i>venture</i> into the street?
</p>

<p>
One day she forced her way into the house.
It was the afternoon before Sir Appleton came
to dine; and Will, who had been sleeping&mdash;on
my suggestion&mdash;at his club, arrived in time to
dress.  Hardly had the door shut behind him
when this girl (you would have thought she had
more pride!) rang the bell and put her unvarying
question.  Mr. William Spenworth was not
at home.  Oh, but he <i>was</i>!  She had just seen
him come in!  (An altercation with a servant
on some one else's door-step!)  Norden behaved
with perfect discretion, asking her to take a
seat while he made enquiries.  After a moment
he returned to say&mdash;once more&mdash;that
Mr. William was not at home.  The girl, from
his account, was in two minds whether to
search the house, but at last she consented
to go.
</p>

<p>
I am not a nervous woman, as you are aware,
but I was <i>thoroughly</i> upset.  A worse prelude
to a <i>momentous</i> meeting could hardly be
imagined.  Will was quite unstrung by the
persecution; and, though I never encourage
him to drink between meals, I said nothing
when he helped himself to brandy.  He needed
it...
</p>

<p>
"Son of mine, we must <i>rally</i>," I said.
"She <i>must</i> see, after this&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go off my head if this goes on any
longer," he said.
</p>

<p>
Utterly unnerved...
</p>

<p>
I had thought it better to send Arthur off
to his club for dinner.  To my mind, it is
inconceivable that a father should be jealous of
his own son, but I can think of no other way
to explain my husband's persistent attitude of
disparagement whenever a united front is most
necessary.  "A policy of pin-pricks" was the
phrase that my boy once coined for it.  We are,
I hope, a devoted family, but Arthur seems
<i>never</i> to lose an opportunity of indulging in a
sneer...  Yet I wish we had had him with us
that night.  In a crisis I am only too well aware
that I am always left to find a way out, but that
night I felt hardly adequate even to ordinary
conversation; and, when this Sir Appleton began
to shew the cloven hoof, I knew that only a
man could deal with him.
</p>

<p>
We were taken utterly off our guard.  He
came into the room, shook hands with me,
bowed to Will, waited until Norden was out of
the room and then said:
</p>

<p>
"There's a lady downstairs who wants to see
one of you for a moment.  She was on the doorstep,
when I arrived, and your servants didn't
want to admit her.  I gathered, however, that
she'd been waiting for some time, so I made
them let her in."
</p>

<p>
<i>Made</i>...  In the school in which I was
brought up, the bare idea of giving orders to
other people's servants...  I do not know
whether you have been forced into contact with
the world of "business men ", but I find their
autocracy sometimes a little trying.
</p>

<p>
"A lady to see me?," I said.  "Really,
this is <i>not</i> a reasonable time for calling."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy it was your son, Lady Ann, that
she asked for," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't be bothered to see people at
this hour of the night," said Will.
</p>

<p>
When Norden came in to announce dinner,
I told him to explain that neither Will nor I
could possibly desert our guest to talk to this
girl at such a time...
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't mind me," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"But I do!," I said.  "And I mind about
dinner."
</p>

<p>
"I should be disposed to see her," said he.
"Perhaps she's in trouble."
</p>

<p>
"It'll keep till to-morrow," said Will.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing so very heartless either
in the words or in the tone, but for some reason
Sir Appleton chose to take offence.
</p>

<p>
"That's not a very sympathetic line to take
with some one who may be in great distress,"
he said.  "For all you know, she's some girl
friend of yours who's stranded in London
without money.  If you'll allow me to say so, Lady
Ann, I think one of you should see her.  It
need not take more than a moment."
</p>

<p>
I fancied that I knew better...
</p>

<p>
"Norden can find out what the matter is
while we're at dinner," I said.  "You'll agree
that it is not a very reasonable hour for calling."
</p>

<p>
"Which is what makes me think that her
business is urgent," said Sir Appleton.  "If
you don't want to be bothered, will you allow
<i>me</i> to interview her?  If it's only a five-pound
note she wants because she's lost her purse..."
</p>

<p>
What could one say?  Obviously he should
not have <i>made</i> such a suggestion, but, as
obviously, I could not forbid him.  It seemed
fair to assume that she would not incriminate
herself with a total stranger or try to blackmail
us through him...  And he had an assurance
of manner which led me to hope that he would
not stand any nonsense from her...
</p>

<p>
"Try&mdash;by all means," I said.
</p>

<p>
And it was on the tip of my tongue to beg
him not to consider us; we could await his
pleasure before thinking about dinner.  But
one had to be civil to the man for this one
night.
</p>

<p>
He was gone for nearly half an hour.  Will
and I waited and waited...  At last he came
back and said:
</p>

<p>
"I must apologize for keeping you so long.
It was a complicated story."  Then he looked
at Will.  "I should like a word with you
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
The agony of that dinner is a thing which
I shall never forget.  Sir Appleton sat in dead
silence for half the meal, then roused himself
to talk about red lacquer.  That was his
nearest approach to China, business...  And,
when we were alone, he turned to Will and
said:
</p>

<p>
"How much does your mother know about it?"
</p>

<p>
"About what?," Will asked, naturally enough.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't try that kind of thing on me,
young man!," cried Sir Appleton in a quite
unpardonable tone.
</p>

<p>
And then, <i>for the first time</i>, I heard the
facts about this girl's unhappy condition.
Will, apparently, knew, but she had not told
her father or Arthur or anybody but Sir
Appleton.  And how much of it was true...
</p>

<p>
"You are accepting this girl's tale?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I believe her."
</p>

<p>
"Without a shadow of evidence?  If Will
<i>assured</i> you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't believe him," he interrupted.
</p>

<p>
To Will's mother, in her own house, at her
own table!  I could see that this was going to
be war to the knife...
</p>

<p>
And then I'm afraid I threw all restraint
to the winds.  After urging Will to be careful,
too.  What I said...  The words poured out
of me in a torrent until my boy stared at me
with round eyes.  Sir Appleton just sat nodding
like a mandarin.  I told him how this girl had
set her trap to catch Will, how she had evidently
resolved to stop at <i>nothing</i> for the chance of
marrying above her station, how she had
persecuted and blackmailed us.  Whatever she had
got, I said, she richly deserved.  Not that I
believed her story!  Oh, not for a single
moment!  As soon as she had <i>forced</i> Will to
marry her, she would laugh in his face for the
trick she had played him.  And, if all this was
true&mdash;her condition and so forth and so on&mdash;,
what possible proof was there that Will was in
any way responsible?
</p>

<p>
"Ask him," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"How should <i>I</i> know?," said Will.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," Sir Appleton cried in triumph.
"Now, young man, what do you propose to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Will.
</p>

<p>
"Then suppose you find out," said Sir
Appleton.  "Are you going to marry her?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!," I cried.  "A thousand times,
no!  She must reap what she has sown.  My
son shall not pay the price of her wickedness."
</p>

<p>
"He promised to marry her," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"Prove it," I said.
</p>

<p>
Oh, if only I had been allowed to see the
mad old father and challenge him!  We should
have heard <i>very</i> little more of Miss Molly
Wanton.  Sir Appleton didn't seem to care
whether he could prove it or not...
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he had to admit, "there's no
<i>proof</i>.  But she says so, and I believe her.
Most of my life, Lady Ann, I've had to form
quick judgements of people and, perhaps three
times out of seven, I know when they're
speaking the truth.  Your son <i>did</i> promise."
</p>

<p>
"He did <i>not</i>!," I retorted.  "It stands
to reason..."
</p>

<p>
And then I tried to <i>hammer</i> a little sense
into his head.  Two people drawn from different
worlds, without an interest in common, without
money.  All his life she would drag him down
and down...  How would he like to see a son
of <i>his</i> in such a position?  ...
</p>

<p>
"He should have thought of that before he
began playing the fool," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"Before <i>he</i> began playing the fool!  A
woman knows well enough...  And a <i>clergyman's</i>
daughter!  You want my boy to marry
her with his knowledge, <i>our</i> knowledge of her
character?  You must be mad!"
</p>

<p>
Will said nothing.  This quite <i>unseemly</i>
altercation, when he was already worn out with
the long persecution...  I wished, oh! I <i>wished</i>
that Arthur had been dining at home; <i>he</i> would
never have allowed us to be bullied like this...
</p>

<p>
"Let's take the next thing, then," proposed
Sir Appleton.  And, do you know, I felt that
he was <i>enjoying</i> our agony.  "Your son is too
fine a gentleman to marry this frail beauty,
though he was not so fastidious when there was
a question of getting her into trouble."  Fine
gentlemen and frail beauties!  The man was
talking like a character in some ridiculous
melodrama!  "Well, he has rather spoiled her for
any other life, so I presume he will gladly pay
what compensation he can.  Even a court of
law would award substantial damages, if she
could prove that there had been a promise of
marriage."
</p>

<p>
"She can't prove it," I said.
</p>

<p>
"And I'm sure you would not like her
to try," he retorted with quite an undisguised
threat in his voice.  "It would cause an ugly
scandal, and you would all gladly pay ten times
whatever damages a jury would give her for the
sake of hushing up the scandal.  Are you
prepared to give her enough to go abroad and, if
need be, live abroad and make a new life for
herself?"
</p>

<p>
"I've no doubt we shall do what we can,"
I said, "<i>if</i> the story's true&mdash;which I don't for
one moment admit at present."
</p>

<p>
I was <i>thankful</i> that he no longer suggested
that Will should marry her...  I'd have
promised anything!  Though why <i>he</i> should make
himself a ruler and a judge...
</p>

<p>
"You will have to provide for her," he
said, "at least as generously as if she were
marrying your son.  She will have no chance
of participating in his prosperity and success
as he rises from triumph to triumph in his
career."
</p>

<p>
I <i>thought</i> I detected a sneer in his voice.  If
I had been sure, I would have suggested that
he ceased insulting my son until we were both
free of the obligation to treat a <i>guest</i> with
courtesy.  The face was curiously expressionless;
I couldn't be certain.
</p>

<p>
"You must not judge every one by your
own standard of wealth," I pointed out.  "We
are very far from rich."
</p>

<p>
"You would settle, say, five thousand a year
on her?," he proposed.  "The cost of living has
reduced that to little more than three thousand
by the standard of prices before the war."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Appleton," I said as patiently as I
could, "if we had five thousand a year to throw
about, we should not be inviting your generous
assistance in finding a position for Will."
</p>

<p>
It was <i>more</i> than time to dismiss this girl
and get to <i>business</i>...
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred, then," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"A <i>year</i>?  For all her life?," I asked,
hardly believing my ears.  If he could have had
any conception what Arthur allows me to dress
on...
</p>

<p>
"Your son's costly regard will affect the
whole of her life," said Sir Appleton.
</p>

<p>
"I won't go into that," I said.  "I admit
nothing.  But I <i>can</i> tell you that it would be out
of the question."
</p>

<p>
"Fifty pounds then?," he went on remorselessly.
"It's less than a pound a week&mdash;with
present purchasing power of about a shilling a
day."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we need discuss this," I said.
"If the story's true, this girl will find that we
shall not behave illiberally to her.  I don't admit
any claim; I was brought up in a stern school
which ordained that a woman should reap as she
had sown.  What you regard as her misfortune,
I was taught to consider the divine, just
punishment of sin."
</p>

<p>
Sir Appleton looked at his watch and rose to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"But you'll pay her a lump sum of a
hundred," he suggested, "to prevent a scandal
and help her through her troubles and keep her
from jumping into the river?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope she would not be so foolish or wicked
as to contemplate such a thing," I told him,
"but I would certainly pay her that."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's right that she should know as
soon as possible," said he.  "I told her to go
round to my house so that my wife could look
after her.  She dare not face her father; and she
was growing rather miserable in lodgings.  If
you will excuse me, I should like just to explain
how the land lies and how much she can hope
from your&mdash;generosity."
</p>

<p>
Will opened the door...  I can see now that
I should have done better to say <i>nothing</i>, but I
could not let him slip away without a <i>word</i> on
the one subject which had made me ask him
... and <i>submit</i> to his company...
</p>

<p>
"And when," I asked, "may we hope to
hear about the appointment?"
</p>

<p>
"The appointment?," he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"The opening you <i>promised</i> to find for
Will," I reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Did I promise?," he asked stupidly; and
then with deliberate malice, "Can you <i>prove</i>
that there was ever a promise?"
</p>

<p>
I reminded him of our talks at Menton.
Goodness me, the man had dined for the express
purpose of meeting Will and deciding what kind
of work would suit him best.
</p>

<p>
"We have to make our plans," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we need discuss this," he
said.  "Your son, as you told me, has no
experience or technical knowledge, so that, if I
employed him at all, I should employ him for
his qualities of character.  I should not dream
of judging any man on a single meeting, so I
think we had better postpone a decision until I
have had better opportunity of studying his
honour and generosity."
</p>

<p>
And that is how we stand at present...
</p>

<p>
Will thinks that there is nothing to hope for
in that quarter, but I cannot believe that, when
a man has given a solemn promise, he will try
to wriggle out of it.  Sir Appleton owes a good
deal to me; but for my advice and really <i>untiring</i>
pains he would still be plain Mr. Deepe,
unknown to any one outside his business...
</p>

<p>
Of the girl we have heard nothing for two
days.  If she <i>must</i> live on some one else's
doorstep, I should be thankful to know that she had
transferred herself to his...
</p>

<p>
But our existence is like life in a beleaguered
city, never knowing when the next attack will
be delivered.

<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH FINDS HER HEART WARMING
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
Indeed I think I may claim that you have come
to the right person.  I returned from the Hall
only this morning, so I am well primed with
news.
</p>

<p>
And very, very happy.  It is only since I
have been established once more in the
beleaguered city that I have had to remember this
menace.  No!  Not a word or sign!  The old
clergyman descended on us from Morecambe,
protesting that my boy Will had promised to
marry his daughter; the daughter came and told
a cock-and-bull story which proved her own
abandonment without establishing anything
against my boy; and, since then, nothing!  But
one does not choose to be a standing target for
that sort of thing.  When next Miss Molly
Phenton (or Wanton) comes to Mount Street,
she may find that Will is safely married to
some one else or that I have sent him abroad.  I
have lost the thread...  Ah, yes, the great
romance!  In that atmosphere of radiance one
forgot one's troubles...
</p>

<p>
My brother Brackenbury did indeed lend me
the house for a few weeks in the summer&mdash;when
every one was away in Scotland&mdash;, but otherwise
I have not passed a night there on their invitation
since that deplorable week-end when all the
trouble with Phyllida began.  You have
forgotten it!  I hope now that every one will
forget it.  Hilary&mdash;Colonel Butler, you know&mdash;had
fallen in love with my niece while he was
in her hospital.  As Phyllida was living with me
at the time, I had a duty to my brother, so I
suggested that this boy should be invited to the
Hall "on approval", as Will would say.  I yield
to no one in my <i>real</i> affection for dear Hilary,
but&mdash;why disguise it?&mdash;he had been brought up
simply&mdash;on modest means&mdash;, and it was only
right that he should see Phyllida in her natural
frame and decide for himself whether he could
support her and live up to it.  Most people so
notoriously <i>cannot</i>: my sister-in-law Ruth, who
remains and will ever remain the purse-proud
shipping magnate's daughter...  I was more
than justified.  Hilary consulted me; and,
though I will never take the responsibility of
advising young people in love, he was grateful
for the detachment of an outsider.  <i>I</i>, he could
see, had no axe to grind...  Brackenbury and
Ruth received him effusively; my nephew
Culroyd took him to his heart; if he had proposed,
he would have been accepted then and there.
He had done too wonderfully in the war
and, in my humble judgement, gave a promise
of success in any career he might undertake.
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i> he consulted to know whether the world
would say that he had married Phyllida for her
money.  He was daunted, I could see, by the
<i>lavishness</i> of the Hall: the size of the house,
the number of servants, Phyllida's four hunters&mdash;and
so forth and so on.  I told him that, <i>in
this respect of money and&mdash;in&mdash;this&mdash;respect&mdash;alone</i>,
he was not in fact contributing very much.
He nodded, packed his bag and went off to
<i>make</i> money&mdash;with an enterprise and a resolution
that was too splendid.  Did I ever tell you
that I once detected him driving a motor-cab?
He has now formed a company and is
doing very well indeed.  It was quite
romantic!  I always knew that there <i>were</i> such
men in England and I was proud to meet one.
</p>

<p>
He begged me not to enlighten Phyllida, as
he wished to leave her entirely free.  Which I
thought a most proper attitude, not extravagantly
common in the youth of the present day.
In my efforts to help him I exposed myself to
an unhappy misconception, for Phyllida persuaded
first herself and then the family that I
had scotched her romance with some crazy idea
of securing her for my boy Will.  It was always
on the tip of my tongue to say that she seemed
very certain of him.  Goodness me, if Will had
<i>wanted</i> her...  I have never wholly approved of
cousin-marriages; and I looked with something
like dismay on their growing intimacy.  That
was later, of course; at first she was like a
demented creature, saying the wildest and
wickedest things.  Do you know that she
charged me with trying to keep my brother-in-law
from getting a divorce&mdash;so that there should
be no possibility of an heir, so that in time
Arthur or Will should inherit Cheniston and the
title?  These are not the fancies of a <i>balanced</i>
mind, and it was then that I urged Brackenbury
to send her <i>right</i> away.  Failing that, I asked
him to entrust her to me for a while in the
hopes that I might turn her thoughts.  Her
loyalty to Colonel Butler I <i>admired</i>, but there
is a danger that love may develop into an
obsession...
</p>

<p>
That was the time when I became so nervous
about Will.  <i>She</i> was listless and unhappy, he
was sympathetic; a dangerous combination!
They had actually, I believe, reached what is
called an understanding, when Phyllida learned
by chance that Colonel Butler was alive and
working in London; and this, I am thankful to
say, turned her attention from Will.  You were
not present, I think, at the great meeting?  No,
I remember you were away; it was one night
when the princess honoured me by dining to
meet a few old friends.  I gave a little
impromptu dance afterwards to some of the officers
in Spenworth's old regiment, not remembering
that Hilary Butler was of the number; Phyllida
was dining, and they met...
</p>

<p>
After that, it was a foregone conclusion.
Every day when I opened my letters or looked
at the paper, I expected to read the
announcement.  You may judge of my misgivings when
my sister-in-law Ruth invited me most urgently
to come for the week-end to the Hall and to
bring Will with me.  I have told you that
there was <i>some</i> sort of understanding: if Hilary
disappeared from human ken, Phyllida would
marry Will&mdash;something of that kind; she was
such a little picture of misery that, if <i>some</i> one
had not shewn her a little kindness, I truly
honestly believe that she would have wilted
away.  I was in dread that she would come up
and say: "Aunt Ann, Will and I are going
to be married"...  <i>That</i> is why I searched
the "Times" so diligently...  It would be
a suitable marriage in some ways: she
<i>has</i> money...  But I could never regard
it as satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
The moment I could get a word alone with
my sister-in-law, I asked her whether they had
seen anything of Colonel Butler.
</p>

<p>
"Not since you arranged that meeting at
your house," Ruth told me, "but he is due
here to-night."  She persists in speaking of
people as though they were ships!  The Hull
strain coming out!  "That is why I invited you
all&mdash;Culroyd and Hilda are coming; and Spenworth
and his wife&mdash;; I wanted you all to meet
him.  Or rather Phyllida did.  She has been
very mysterious, but there seems to be no doubt
now..."
</p>

<p>
"They are going to be married?," I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing has been said about it&mdash;<i>yet</i>,"
answered Ruth.
</p>

<p>
I know you will not misunderstand me, still
less make mischief, if I tell you that I heaved
a <i>sigh</i> of relief.  Fond as I am of Phyllida, she
would not have made a very suitable wife for
Will, though it is essential for him to marry
some one with a <i>little</i> money and I have felt
lately that, if he could marry <i>any one</i>, it would
put an end to this persecution from the girl
who is trying to blackmail him...  At the same
time it seemed a little strange for Phyllida to
be summoning the entire family, when, so far
as I could make out, Hilary had not said a
<i>word</i>...
</p>

<p>
"So you are expecting Colonel Butler," I
said to her at tea.
</p>

<p>
"He's coming to-day," she answered rather
brusquely.  "I thought he might have been
here by now...  <i>Well</i>, Aunt Ann, was I wise
to wait?  You told me to go right away and
forget him; you always said you wanted to turn
my thoughts."
</p>

<p>
Do you know, for a dreadful moment I
fancied that she was trying to reopen her insane
vendetta...  When she circulated those truly
wicked stories about me...
</p>

<p>
"Dear Phyllida," I said, "did I ever try
to shake your faith in him?  No one, not even
you, has a greater admiration or regard for
Colonel Butler; he has done me more than one
inestimable service, and I think he would be
the first to admit that he owes something to
my friendship and advice.  Ask him, dear
child!  I have nothing to fear from his
testimony; but there is a right way and a
wrong way in most things, and he will tell
you that, on my advice, he chose the right.  If
I urged your father to send you away, if I tried
to the best of my poor abilities to distract your
thoughts, it was because I could not bear to
see my own niece, my own brother's child, the
picture of misery that you were."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd look miserable," said Phyllida,
"if the one person you cared for had been
set against you and if everybody said you'd
tried to capture him and he'd run away."
</p>

<p>
Who it was that Phyllida imagined she was
quoting I have really no idea.  It was on the
tip of my tongue to tell her that, if a girl
conducts a love affair quite so ostentatiously as she
had done, she must not be surprised if people
ask questions when, all of a sudden, nothing
comes of it.  It was hardly the moment to talk
about ostentation, however.  You remember
the terrace at the Hall; we were sitting there
like people in the first row of the stalls, waiting
for the curtain to go up&mdash;Brackenbury, Ruth,
their boy Culroyd and Hilda, his wife, my
brother-in-law Spenworth, <i>his</i> new wife,
Arthur, Will and myself.  I really pitied any
poor young man with such an audience to face...
</p>

<p>
"But all has now turned out well?," I
asked.  "Dear Phyllida, I am very, very glad."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't congratulate me yet," she said.
"He hasn't <i>said</i> anything."
</p>

<p>
I was really <i>amazed</i>...
</p>

<p>
"I thought perhaps that, when you met at
my house&mdash;," I began.
</p>

<p>
After all, <i>if</i>&mdash;as I hope&mdash;everything goes
well, I am entitled to a <i>little</i> credit...
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not a word!," said Phyllida.  "He
wouldn't even dance with me at first.  I said:
'Are you trying to avoid me?'  He said:
'Yes.' ... And I could have died till I saw
he was only joking.  Then we both laughed.
Then he said: 'Would your mother invite me
down to the Hall one week-end soon?  It's only
fair to warn her that, if she doesn't, I shall invite
myself.'  'And, if you don't invite yourself, I
shall invite you,' I told him.  'Don't let's say
anything at present,' he said; 'I've been very
busy since I saw you last, but I shall be free in
a week or two.'  He wired on Wednesday to
know if he might come.  I knew you would
like to meet him and to see that my faith
was justified."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Phyllida," I said.  "I hope indeed
that it has been."
</p>

<p>
"If he doesn't propose to me," answered
Phyllida, "I shall propose to him.  I always
told you I would."
</p>

<p>
Of course, I am old-fashioned; I was
brought up in a different school.  Do you
know, even in jest, between the two of us, that
kind of speech is always very distasteful to
me...
</p>

<p>
Apparently the young man was motoring
from London, and there was some sort of idea
that he would arrive in time for tea.  We
maintained our absurd theatrical postures until
the terrace became too unbearably cold.  When
I went up to dress, he had not arrived; but
Phyllida was still sitting with her gaze fixed
down the drive to the white gates of the
lodge...  It may have been love; but I could
not help feeling that she was <i>very</i> conscious of
the <i>effect</i>...
</p>

<p>
When I came down at half-past eight,
there was still no sign of him.  And then you
can imagine the inevitable discussion!  Was
he coming or was he not?  Should we wait or
should we begin without him?  Phyllida
expressed no opinion; she sat by herself,
waiting...  At nine o'clock I took Arthur and
Will on one side and told them that we must
really make a concerted attack on Ruth; I was
<i>famished</i>...
</p>

<p>
"He <i>can't</i> be coming," I said.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Phyllida overheard me and
interpreted this as an attack on Colonel Butler's
good faith...
</p>

<p>
"He <i>said</i> he would come," she persisted.
Over one shoulder, you know...  With a toss
of the head.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the car has broken down," I
suggested.  "There may have been an accident."
</p>

<p>
"He will come," said Phyllida.
</p>

<p>
At a quarter past nine Ruth was merciful
enough to allow her guests to have a little
food&mdash;one of those meals where, as my boy said
very wittily, "everything was cold except the
ice."  A hideous dinner!  I am not now
referring to the food, but to the atmosphere.
Phyllida refused to come in; Brackenbury
wavered and wobbled, now going out to her,
now coming back...  And the one <i>not</i> very
interesting topic of conversation: what had
happened to Colonel Butler.  By ten o'clock
<i>most</i> of us had made up our minds that he was
not coming...
</p>

<p>
By eleven I really believe some were wondering
whether he had ever <i>intended</i> to come.  He
had invited himself, it is true.  Or so we were
told.  But it really seemed as though the
initiative came from Phyllida, that she might be
forcing his hand, that he had suggested coming
really as a means of ending the discussion at
my dance.  <i>I</i> did not know what letters had
passed between them since.  She might have
been pressing and pressing him until he at last
consented to come; then he may have seen that,
once at the Hall, he would not be allowed to
escape a second time.  He may have invited
himself with the reservation that he would stop
away at the last moment and say that he had
been called abroad.  Phyllida is <i>attractive</i>, she
is rich; for people who care about these things,
she is the daughter of an earl.  Undeniably
young Butler had been glamoured by it all at
first; but he may well have felt on reconsideration
that it would not be a very suitable match,
and I have yet to learn that a man thinks more
highly of a girl because she throws herself at
his head.  That is a lesson which the rising
generation will have to learn&mdash;at a heavy price.
</p>

<p>
I felt that some such thoughts must be
passing through Spenworth's mind every time
he said: "The fellow's not coming to-night.
Can't some one persuade that child to have
some food instead of giving herself a
chill?"  Brackenbury and Ruth, too, were beginning to
doubt and to look very much concerned.  If
the young man <i>had</i> sheered off, they would
never forgive themselves for allowing the
unhappy girl to make such an exhibition of
herself...  In my heart of hearts I knew that
Colonel Butler could be trusted as I would
trust my own son.  I was only afraid that
there might have been an <i>accident</i>...
</p>

<p>
And I could fancy what poor Phyllida's
feelings must be after assembling all the family
to meet her soldier-hero, after telling me at the
top of her <i>very</i> clear little voice that, if he did
not propose to her, she would propose to him...
Every one would say that he had run away
and she had dragged him back and now he had
run away again...
</p>

<p>
At half-past eleven we gave up hope.
</p>

<p>
"He can't be coming to-night," Ruth told
Phyllida.  "Let's all go to bed; we shall hear
something in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"He <i>said</i> he would come," Phyllida answered.
</p>

<p>
There was another aimless discussion when
we were all so tired that we could hardly keep
our eyes open.  Brackenbury went out to see
what <i>he</i> could do with the girl&mdash;and returned
to say that she had vanished!
</p>

<p>
Oh, my dear!  Our <i>feelings</i> I leave you to
imagine.  In some directions Phyllida has a
wild, insane pride ... and she had seen it
dragged in the mire before the eyes of us all.
When I spoke of love degenerating into
obsession, I chose my words with care: for months
the child had been so <i>distraught</i> that I felt a
<i>very</i> little more might upset her reason.
Rapidly reviewing all that had passed that day,
I recalled the utter desperation of her
behaviour&mdash;the ruined gambler's last throw...  We stood
as though we had been carved out of stone,
<i>staring</i> at Brackenbury while he <i>stared</i> at us
... white as paper.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking of the river...
</p>

<p>
We seemed unable to move...
</p>

<p>
At last Spenworth hurled himself through
the door, with Brackenbury, Culroyd, Arthur,
goodness knows who at his heels.  I caught
Will's arm and went with him on to the terrace;
it was time that <i>some one</i> kept his head.  Do
you know, I had a premonition: a moonless
night, that inky river, demented, shouting men
jostling one another on the bank and in the
water, plunging and splashing, a cry for help,
some one caught in the reeds, two&mdash;three
tragedies instead of one...
</p>

<p>
"The boat-house, Will," I urged.
</p>

<p>
We dashed along the terrace and across the
lawn.  Suddenly I stopped.  Ahead of me&mdash;in
the darkness I could not see how far&mdash;there was
a flash of white.  It vanished, appeared again,
vanished again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>This</i> way," I said.
</p>

<p>
And I could have sobbed aloud.  Instead of
making for the river, poor Phyllida was roaming
distractedly towards the lodge.  We heard
her feet stumbling on and off the gravel, there
came the moan of a tortured animal...  The
footsteps ceased abruptly, the white coat
vanished...  She had left the drive and turned
away behind a clump of laurel.  I heard her
crying as though her heart would break...
</p>

<p>
"I can run no farther," I said to Will.
"And an old woman like me is no good to her
now.  Go to her and comfort her.  You have
always loved her, so you will know what to say.
If she breaks her heart, she will break yours too;
you will never forgive yourself for abandoning
her.  Let her see that, however lonely and
deserted she may feel, one staunch friend is true
to her through all things.  It is your right and
privilege to share her sorrow and, if may be, to
assuage it."
</p>

<p>
At such a time my boy did not need to be
told twice.  As I sank exhausted against a tree,
he stole forward; I heard him calling her softly
by name.  If I could, I would have hurried out
of ear-shot, for whatever he said was sacred to
the two of them; but I expected every moment
to faint with my unaccustomed exertion...
</p>

<p>
"Phyllida...  Darling Phyllida," he began.
</p>

<p>
I do not mind telling <i>you</i>, because you are
always discreet and, when reverence is
demanded, you will be reverent...  I thought I
knew my boy, but there are depths of tenderness
in a man which he never shews to his own
mother...
</p>

<p>
"Phyllida, darling Phyllida, won't you let
me comfort you?  If you break your heart, you
will break mine too.  You know that I have
always loved you, and that gives me the right
to comfort you when you are unhappy.
Whatever other people may do to you or say to you,
I am always here for you to turn to..."
</p>

<p>
I cannot go on...  Already I have said more
than I ought.  Will you think your old friend
very foolish if she confesses that for a moment
she forgot that she was old?  Time slipped from
my shoulders, and I saw once again a young
girl in that very garden, not a hundred yards
from where I was standing...  Dear Phyllida,
I suppose, would think her a very funny,
old-fashioned creature, but I did not seem so
then&mdash;certainly to Arthur...  A young girl in a
white dress with a young man pleading at her
feet until his voice broke and he said: "It's
no good, I can't go on."  And then he threw
his arms about me...  And I remember my
dear father coming on to the terrace and calling
out to me.  And Arthur seized my hand and
<i>strode</i> forward with his head among the <i>stars</i>...
Brackenbury&mdash;he is fourteen years my junior&mdash;was
already in bed, but we insisted on going
upstairs to tell him the news.  Life was a very
glorious thing that night.  I walked on air;
and, if any one had told me that it was a thing
of greed and cruelty and ingratitude and mean
passions, I should have laughed him to scorn...
</p>

<p>
Forgive me...
</p>

<p>
I am sentimental, no doubt, but if we <i>have</i>
the opportunity of feeling our heart warming...
Of late years...  I have lost the thread...
Ah, yes!  I crept away, leaving them together,
with the murmur of my boy's divine sympathy
still in my ears.  At first I walked aimlessly,
trying to keep my mind <i>blank</i> until I was
competent to think of anything.  What <i>would</i>
happen now? ... In time I found myself on
the lawn once more, and the sight of the river
reminded me of duty still left undone.  I had
to find Brackenbury and tell him that his child
was safe and in good hands...  I remember
wondering, trying to make up my mind what
I should think if this <i>crise</i> shewed Phyllida that
it was Will she wanted to marry...
</p>

<p>
There was no one in sight.  I walked
cautiously to the river, expecting every moment
to step over the edge...  No sound of voices.  I
called: "Brackenbury!", "Arthur!",
"Culroyd!".  There was no answer.  Do you know
that quite unreasoning fear that sometimes
overtakes one when one is in the dark and knows
that one is not <i>alone</i>?  And the river&mdash;like a
looking-glass in a twilit room...  I have a horror
of any great expanse of water at night; it is
so silent and merciless.  "Culroyd!  Brackenbury!
Spenworth!," I called again&mdash;this time
at the top of my voice.  And then I am not
ashamed to confess that I hurried back to the
house as fast as my legs would carry me.
</p>

<p>
It was no less deserted than the garden!
Lights blazing, doors and windows open, but
not a soul in sight; the very servants pressed
into the hue-and-cry.  I wandered through room
after room, upstairs and down.  When I went
back to the terrace, it was with the crazy feeling
that the world had come to an end and I alone
was left...  Suddenly a step on the gravel!
And I do assure you that I did not know whether
to scream with fear or sob with relief.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Ann!"
</p>

<p>
I was <i>far</i> beyond recognizing voices.  I
<i>peered</i> into the darkness until the figure of a
man emerged from the shadows...
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Butler!," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Phyllida?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Goodness me, what have you been doing
to yourself?," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
His clothes were in <i>rags</i>, he had lost his hat,
he was plastered in mud from head to foot, and
one arm was in some sort of make-shift sling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's nothing," he said.  "A fool of
a girl was riding a horse she couldn't control,
and, in trying not to run her down, I had to
turn the car over an embankment.  There was
no station within reach, so I had to come here
across country.  I'd have wired; but, by the
time I reached a telegraph-office, everything was
closed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But have you had no dinner?," I asked,
remembering our own fate.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any dinner till I know what's
happened to Phyllida.  When did she
disappear?  Lord Brackenbury says she was out
here one moment...  If any thing's happened
to her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Calm yourself, Colonel Butler," I enjoined.
</p>

<p>
Indeed I might as profitably have addressed
the advice to myself.  It was time for some one
to keep his head.  I was thinking only of
Phyllida and the effect that <i>another</i> shock might
have upon her.  She was already so much
overwrought, sobbing her heart out when any of us
could have told her that there was <i>nothing</i> to
cry about...
</p>

<p>
"We've been searching high and low," said
Colonel Butler.  "Lord Brackenbury told me
that she suddenly bolted into the night.  We
haven't dared shout for fear of frightening her
away...  What's it all about?  In the name of
God, what can have happened to her?"
</p>

<p>
"If you stay here," I said, "I will find
her for you."
</p>

<p>
"But do you know where she is?," he cried
in great excitement.  "I must come too."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you trust my judgement, Colonel
Butler?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated for a moment and then said:
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will.  You've been a jolly
good friend to me.  But for pity's sake go at
once; I can't stand much more."
</p>

<p>
"If you know where the others are," I
suggested, "you might employ your time in
finding them."
</p>

<p>
Then I set off down the drive once more.  I
walked on the grass, but, on reaching the
laurel-clump, I gave a little cough to apprise them of
my presence.  Poor Phyllida was so much
overwrought that she started to her feet like a
frightened animal.  (She had been lying with
her face in her arms, while Will stroked her hair
and whispered such little words of comfort as
came into his head.)
</p>

<p>
"Will, I want to speak to you a moment," I said.
</p>

<p>
And, when he came to me, I told him to go
down to the lodge gates and wait there till I
fetched him.  Then I tried to make <i>some</i>
impression on poor Phyllida, who was indulging in
such an abandonment of grief that you would
really say that she was enjoying it.
</p>

<p>
"Phyllida, stop crying," I said, "and listen
to what I have to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why can't you leave me alone?," she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Because," I said, "there is great and
glorious news for you, and your old aunt is
selfish enough to wish to be its bearer."
</p>

<p>
You may be sure that she stopped her crying
soon enough at that.
</p>

<p>
I told her that Hilary Butler had arrived...
And about the accident; she tried to bolt from
my grasp, but I contrived to restrain her...
And the dreadful fright she had been wicked
enough to give us...
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me go!," she kept crying.
</p>

<p>
"A moment more, dearest child," I said.
"You are both over-excited, overwrought.
Would you not like to meet him alone first,
without feeling that the eyes of all your family
are upon you?" ...
</p>

<p>
She is an impetuous, affectionate little thing.
In a moment she was kissing me and making my
face quite wet with her tears...
</p>

<p>
"We will go into the rose-garden," I
said.  "Many years before you were born, dear
Phyllida, another girl stood there with the man
who loved her more than any one in the world.
May you be at least not less happy than she has
been!" ...
</p>

<p>
Then I returned to the house.  Hilary had
collected most of the party, and I whispered to
him that he would find Phyllida by the sun-dial...
I am not so well used to praise from my
occasionally critical relations that I can afford to
treat it lightly; Spenworth was good enough to
propose three cheers for me when he heard of
my <i>childishly</i> simple little stratagem for letting
the young people meet unlistened to, unspied on...
</p>

<p>
"And now had not the rest of us better
go to bed?," I suggested to Ruth.  "If all is
as we hope, you and Brackenbury would sooner
not be embarrassed by our presence."
</p>

<p>
Poor Ruth is consistent in one thing: she
never shews any instinct for <i>arranging</i> or
<i>managing</i>.  It is perhaps not to be expected
that she should take to it by the light of nature,
but one would have thought that the first
ambition of any woman who had been transported
from one <i>milieu</i> to another would have
been to <i>learn</i>...  She is in a position of
authority...
</p>

<p>
When they had all separated to their rooms,
I once more set out...  Will, I think, had
guessed; and I have never seen any one more
delighted.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> knew the fellow would turn up," he said,
"but I couldn't make poor little Phyl see it.
I suppose she thought he <i>must</i> have killed
himself on the road.  Just as well he didn't,
because I believe she's quite fond of him.
I should think they'd get on quite well
together, though of course she's not everybody's
money."
</p>

<p>
I explained to him that every one had gone
to bed, but here he was <i>quite</i> immovable.
</p>

<p>
"I want to be the first to congratulate
them," he said.
</p>

<p>
Which I thought was <i>handsome</i>, when you
remember how Phyllida threw herself at his
head.
</p>

<p>
They are to be married as soon as Hilary's
company has been formed.  He is very anxious
that Arthur should join the board, but I am
not sure that it is wise to undertake <i>too</i> many
enterprises.  One is always reluctant to refuse
what is really a tempting offer&mdash;on a small
scale&mdash;, but there <i>are</i> only twenty-four hours in
the day...
</p>

<p>
One quite rubs one's eyes when the younger
generation knocks at the door in this way.  How
old would you say Phyllida was?  Twenty-two,
I assure you; and I know what I am talking
about.  It will be my boy's turn next, I
suppose; he is nearly thirty-one.  And, though
I do not want to lose him, I shall not be sorry
to see him <i>safely</i> married.
</p>

<p>
I hope that Phyllida will make a success of
her life.  I have every reason to think she will,
but I refuse to accept any responsibility for
guiding young people to their affinities.  After
one irrational period in which I was the wicked
stepmother, I suddenly find myself regarded as
the good fairy...
</p>

<p>
It is really too ridiculous...
</p>

<p>
Oh, I think you can congratulate them at
once.  They are to be "Morning-Posted", as
Will would say, to-morrow...
</p>

<br><br>
LADY ANN SPENWORTH DEFENDS HER CONSISTENCY
</h3>

<p>
<i>Lady Ann</i> (<i>to a friend of proved discretion</i>):
Consistency?
</p>

<p>
It is very easy, of course, to <i>overdo</i> that sort
of thing, to become so inflexible that one is
the slave and victim of one's own rules.  The
Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath...  On the other hand, I have no
patience with the people who say one thing
to-day and another to-morrow, so that you never
know where you are with them.  Surely the wise
course is to discover the great laws and hold to
them unswervingly, only stepping aside by a
hair's breadth to left or right when the great laws
quite obviously apply no longer.  In the realm
of principle I admit no compromise; Right is
Right, and Wrong is Wrong, and no amount of
special pleading can blur <i>that</i> distinction...
</p>

<p>
But, though I hold no <i>brief</i> for consistency,
I should be vastly entertained to know exactly
where you think I have been inconsistent...
Not you personally, of course!  We have known
each other long enough to look out on life with
very much the same eyes.  But the people who
are good enough to criticize me without, perhaps,
taking the trouble to ascertain even the facts
of the case.
</p>

<p>
I have always said that I would not stir a
finger to interfere with my boy Will, or any one
else of that age, where the heart was concerned.
They, for all their inexperience, must be the
ultimate judges; the wisdom of <i>instinct</i> and so
on and so forth.  The responsibility on an outsider
is too great even for advice; and the advice
of a mother to the son who adores her...  There
is such a thing as having too much power put
into one's hands.  I don't say I'm <i>right</i>; but,
if Will married a girl whom I considered the
most unsuitable person in the world...  So long
as <i>he</i> loved <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> loved <i>him</i>...  Have I
been inconsistent there?
</p>

<p>
I have always said that for a boy of his
tastes and upbringing <i>some</i> little money is
essential as light and air.  A truism!  Have I been
inconsistent here?
</p>

<p>
I don't want to blow my own trumpet, as
they say; and I resent this modern practice of
proclaiming to the whole world how much one
loves one's own flesh and blood&mdash;as though it
were something very new and wonderful; but
<i>you</i> have never doubted that I would sell the
clothes from off my back and the roof from over
my head if Will's happiness depended on it.
You are good enough to talk about my
"sacrifices", but am I being anything more than
normal, natural and consistent, a mother brought
up in a certain school of a certain period?
</p>

<p>
I think that, if the facts were ever known,
you would find I had been loyal to my principles.
They never will be&mdash;for obvious reasons...
With you, of course, it is different; I have told
you everything and laid my heart bare.  Should
I have done that, if there was anything to
conceal?  And if the last chapter would really
interest you...
</p>

<p>
A <i>superficial</i> change undoubtedly there has
been, corresponding to a profound change in all
our conditions.  A year or two ago...  It is not
too much to call it a revolution, so many
unexpected things have happened.  In those days
one never dreamed that my brother-in-law would
drag what I suppose I must call his "honour"
through the Divorce Court; and, so long as poor
Kathleen bore him one daughter after another,
it seemed safe to presume that Cheniston and the
title would come sooner or later to Arthur and,
through him, to our boy.  The problem of that
period was to "carry on", as Will would say;
my brother Brackenbury and his wife would not
like to be called mean, but they were certainly
<i>careful</i>, and it was only by eternal pinching and
scraping that we made both ends meet.  Many
young men in Will's position would have put
themselves up to auction, as it were, and married
the first rich woman who came their way.  Goodness
me, my boy had a big enough choice!  First
of all Hilda, and he resigned his claims there to
my nephew Culroyd; then the South American
widow, but he very quickly saw how unsuitable
<i>that</i> would be; and you may say&mdash;without any
unkindness&mdash;that my niece Phyllida was waiting
all the time for him to drop the handkerchief
and only consented to marry Hilary Butler when
the other thing was out of the question.
Unfortunately you can't please <i>everybody</i>, and Will
was old-fashioned enough to desire a wife with
whom he could be in love and to shut his ears
to all the lures of money...  Money?  A man
of his ability can always <i>earn</i> money, and our
only difficulty was to know where to start.  He
contemplated <i>la haute finance</i> for a while, but
was repelled by the prospect of having to work
with men like Sir Adolf Erckmann; then he
explored the possibilities of Mr. Surdan's
shipyards, but this for some reason was not to his
taste.  Now I truly honestly believe that he has
found his <i>métier</i>....
</p>

<p>
While he was still undecided about his career,
I was reluctant to part with the house in Mount
Street, though for many years it had really been
too expensive for us.  One grows, indeed, to
love one's own vine and fig-tree, and the place
was <i>filled</i> with associations.  Did I ever tell you
that the princess was good enough to say that,
in coming there, she always felt she was coming
<i>home</i>? ... With Will gone, the place is a
white elephant; and I cannot flatter myself that
any little <i>niche</i> I may occupy makes me
indispensable to the life of London.  When people
talk about inconsistency, they fancy a change
in <i>you</i>, but it doesn't occur to them that the
world all <i>round</i> you may have changed.  I
had long contemplated <i>radical</i> alterations
and was only perplexed to know where to
begin.
</p>

<p>
Our thoughts had all been turned for the
moment from our own affairs by the romance of
my dear niece Phyllida's engagement to Colonel
Butler.  Alas! when we came back to London,
it was to find what I then regarded as a sword
<i>still</i> suspended over our heads, <i>still</i> hanging by
a hair.  Since the night when Sir Appleton
Deepe dined with us to discuss the appointment
for Will, this girl Molly Phenton had not been
near the house.  For a week before that she had
been calling, waiting, writing&mdash;always protesting
that my boy had given her a promise of marriage.
As it was impossible for them to marry without
money, I refused to believe that Will had
promised; not believing this story of a promise,
I felt that she was trying to blackmail us;
feeling <i>that</i>, I declined to see her.  One thing
followed automatically from another.  It was
not until she called that evening and Sir
Appleton&mdash;<i>rather</i> officiously, if you'll promise not to
tell any one I said so&mdash;insisted on interviewing
her, that I learned the truth about her
condition.  <i>Then</i>, I am sure, we should all have
agreed that Will must marry her at once, but
Sir Appleton would give us no time.  I suppose
concentration on one object is very necessary
in business, but it <i>does</i> limit a man's outlook:
Sir Appleton could see but this one thing.
"My good sir," I wanted to tell him, "shew
us <i>how</i> it is to be done, and it <i>will</i> be
done."  But he would not discuss the appointment,
though he had given me as solemn a promise as
a man can give; he dashed home, after sending
this girl on ahead, and we heard no more of them.
</p>

<p>
I felt that it was useless to talk to my boy
just then, because he was so much worried that
anything more might have brought on a
complete break-down.  My husband too...  I
respect Arthur's judgement at other times, but,
where his own son is concerned, I find him
curiously unsympathetic.  I pretended to myself
that I was trying to find a new opening for
Will, now that Sir Appleton had played us so
shamefully false, but I'm afraid that I was
simply letting things drift...
</p>

<p>
Then my brother-in-law Spenworth paid me
the rare honour of a visit.  He had come up
from Cheniston on purpose, though&mdash;to judge
from his voice&mdash;you would have thought he was
still trying to make himself heard from the
fastnesses of Warwickshire...
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear Ann," he roared, "I've
come to give you a piece of my mind."
</p>

<p>
Do you know, had the retort not been so
cheaply obvious, one would have been strongly
tempted to ask whether he could really spare
it...  So characteristic of Spenworth!  I am
not a woman to bear malice, but I could not
forget that <i>very</i> few days had passed since he
played me a trick which to that type of mind,
no doubt, seems funny, but which <i>might</i> have
involved me in <i>embarrassment</i> and <i>humiliation</i>.
It was one night when the princess was with
me; Spenworth had been presiding over some
regimental dinner and he thought it would be
an amusing hoax to send all these young
officers&mdash;with partners whom they had apparently
picked up one really dares not contemplate
<i>where</i>&mdash;on the pretext that I was giving a dance
and would be delighted to see them.  Dear
Hilary Butler's presence of mind <i>alone</i> saved the
situation.  I detest practical joking and, when
my brother-in-law was announced, I confess that
I expected less to be lectured than to receive
some little expression of regret...
</p>

<p>
<i>Hoped</i> rather than <i>expected</i>...  You are
quite right.
</p>

<p>
"I must beg for enlightenment," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's that scamp of a boy of yours
been up to?," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I will <i>not</i> permit such language about my
son!," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Too late now.  You should have brought
him up better," he said.
</p>

<p>
This from Spenworth, whose life has been
one dark, unbroken record of debauchery,
unfaithfulness ... not a tenth part known owing
to his cleverness in hushing up scandals,
impoverishing that glorious estate to buy the silence
of those who held awkward secrets.  Indeed I
know what I am talking about.  When he
wanted poor Kathleen to divorce him, he gave
her the run of Cheniston; heirlooms apart, she
might take anything "to feather her new nest",
as he elegantly put it.  And this in a house
which will come to Arthur and Will if anything
happens to that sickly baby...  There was a
<i>marvellous</i> story going the rounds a few months
ago that I had tried to entangle Kathleen with
the King's Proctor or the President of the
Divorce Court or somebody of the kind, so that
she might be tied to Spenworth and Cheniston
have no heir.  Comment...  What is the
phrase?  Comment is superfluous!  But, if
Arthur or Will were steward of Cheniston, they
would give a better account of their stewardship
than my brother-in-law is likely to do...  I
have lost the thread...  Ah, yes!
</p>

<p>
"Satan rebuking sin, Spenworth," I suggested,
"though I have no idea what charge you
are bringing against my boy."
</p>

<p>
"You can have a good time in this world
without being a cad," he said.  "At least I
hope <i>I</i> can.  Apparently your precious Will
can't."
</p>

<p>
"Have a good time"!  <i>There</i> is a phrase to
put you on your guard!
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," I said.  "I
don't know what's the matter with you.  But
I <i>do</i> know that we shan't do any good by
continuing this discussion."
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast," said Spenworth, as I walked
to the bell.  "<i>You</i> asked me to second that
little beast at the club.  I <i>did</i>.  I went there
the other day and was told that some fellow
with a name like Apple-pie-bed had told Will
that, if he ever dared shew his nose inside the
door again, he'd be kicked into the street.
Well, as it's our misfortune to share a common
name, I took it on myself to have Mr. Apple-pie-bed
pointed out to me; I asked him if he
didn't think that perhaps he was being a little
high-handed.  I don't allow <i>every</i> Chinese
grocer to take liberties with me.  He said:
'I'm sorry the feller should be a relation of
yours, but for the sake of the club I must stick
to what I threatened.  You'd better report me
to the committee when it's all over, and we
shall then see whether, on a show-down, my
action is approved.'  That, my dear Ann, is
all I know; but, in case you're not aware of
it, any reflection on a man I've supported at a
club is a reflection on me; if the young cub had
been pilled, I should have had to resign; if he
gets hoofed out, people will want to know why
the hell I ever backed him..."
</p>

<p>
As you know, I am always lost in admiration
of Spenworth's <i>elegance</i> of diction.  And
all delivered as though he were cheering hounds
on to a line.  Everything in my poor little house
<i>trembled</i>...
</p>

<p>
Truly honestly I had no idea that men in
their clubs could be such great babies...

"Sir Appleton Deepe&mdash;<i>that</i> is his name,
Spenworth; I am not sure whether you were
trying to be facetious&mdash;," I said, "is evidently
a queer-tempered man.  I have had evidence of
it before.  Should you engage in conversation
with him again, you may tell him that he
touches a hair of Will's head <i>at his peril</i>.  I
have nothing more to say except that <i>in</i> your
club you seem to be as violent and disorderly
as out of it."
</p>

<p>
There was a certain amount more <i>noise</i>
... and <i>bluster</i>.  But I think that in time even
Spenworth must have seen that he was hardly
the appropriate person to champion such a
cause ... whatever cause he imagined he <i>was</i>
championing...  Hardly had he left when my
nephew was announced&mdash;and came in with a
great show of embarrassment.  I am very fond
of Culroyd; so far as any one, without taking
the responsibility of active interference, can
help to bring two young people together...
Both Culroyd and Hilda persist in regarding
me as their good fairy...
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," I said, "what is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm&mdash;in the deuce of a hole, Aunt
Ann," he answered.  "Where's Will?"
</p>

<p>
"He has not come in yet," I said.  "Tell
me what has happened."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Culroyd, "I think you know
a man called Deepe, Appleton Deepe."  My
heart <i>sank</i>!  "He called on me to-day&mdash;I don't
know if the fellow's mad, but he said: 'You're
a cousin of Mr. William Spenworth, aren't
you?  Now, he's been doing one of the things
that a gentleman <i>doesn't</i> do; and some one has
to thrash him for it.  I'll say that there's a girl
mixed up in it, but I won't tell you any more.
She has no brothers, and her father's too old
to do justice to the occasion.  The question is:
who's to give him his thrashing?  I'm not as
vigorous as I could wish; but I'll undertake it,
if I must.  If, on the other hand, you'll do it
for me and do it properly, we may save a
scandal; I shouldn't like to injure his mother
in any way, but he has to have his thrashing.' ...
Well, I didn't know whether the
fellow was in his right mind...  I tried to get
him to tell me something more...  Then I said
I'd think it over...  What the devil's Will been
up to now?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Now?</i>," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
Really, I will stand a good deal from
Culroyd, because he is my nephew and I am very
fond of him.  But I would not submit to being
hectored by my relations old and young, one
after another.  Goodness me, the next thing
would be that I should have to give sureties to
<i>Phyllida</i> and allow <i>Ruth</i> to make herself a
ruler and a judge...
</p>

<p>
"Well, what does it mean?," Culroyd persisted.
</p>

<p>
"You have suggested," I said, "that this
Sir Appleton Deepe was mad; I can only fear
that his madness was contagious."
</p>

<p>
I was <i>beside</i> myself with anger...  And at
the same time <i>highly</i> uneasy.  Will had not
been going to his club the last few days because
of this girl's practice of camping on the doorstep
there; and it was long past the time when
he usually came home.  Culroyd shrugged his
shoulders and said good-bye.  I waited&mdash;on and
on.  Seven o'clock, half-past seven, eight.  I
was just going up to dress when Norden rang
through to say that some one wished to speak
to me on the telephone.
</p>

<p>
Need I tell you that it was Sir Appleton
Deepe?  My dear, by that time I should have
been amazed if it had been any one <i>else</i>; he
seemed to dog my steps and pervade my life.
As, he said, I was apparently expecting Will
home to dinner, I should no doubt like to know
that my boy was with him; they had met in
the street, and he had <i>persuaded</i> him to come
home...
</p>

<p>
You have met the man, of course.  Well,
I wonder whether you will agree with me here.
Ordinarily, I should say, he had the furtive,
apologetic manner of one who is not quite
certain of himself; once roused, even by
something that the detached outsider might think
was <i>not</i> quite his business, he is a changed man.
I am thinking now of his voice; the telephone
had changed its <i>timbre</i> into something quite
terribly sinister.  The way he said he had
<i>persuaded</i> Will to come home with him!  And
then he went on to ask whether he could not
<i>persuade</i> me, if I was not already engaged, to
join them, as they were discussing certain
things in which I really ought to have a say...
</p>

<p>
Of course I went just as soon as Norden
could find me a taxi.  Will has the courage of
a lion, but I would not leave him at the mercy
of that epileptic creature when I knew that for
weeks he had been so much overwrought and
worried that the least thing might bring on a
break-down...  Besides, if Sir Appleton had
repented his haste in throwing away an
opportunity of securing my boy's services in his
business, a mother's guidance and judgement
could never be more needed; I do not wholly
trust these "captains of commerce"; if they
did not know how to drive a very hard bargain,
they would not be where they are...
</p>

<p>
I found them in Sir Appleton's study&mdash;doing
nothing in particular, so far as I could
make out, though Will was drinking whisky
and soda, which shewed me that he must be
greatly overwrought.
</p>

<p>
"It is good of you to come, Lady Ann,"
said Sir Appleton.  "You have not had time
to forget our last meeting.  I was made aware
then of several things: as that your son had
taken advantage of a young girl's innocence
and was leaving her to bear the consequences...
As that you were opposed heart and soul to
such a <i>mésalliance</i> as would result from his
marrying her...  As that you were unhappily
not in a position to make adequate financial
provision for her, but that you would pay her
a hundred pounds 'in full discharge', as we
say in business...  <i>I</i> felt that, as there was no
law to cope with such gentry as your son, some
one must take the law into his own hands.
Now, Miss Phenton had no relations of an
age to protect her, and your nephew seemed
reluctant to vindicate the family honour&mdash;I
sympathize with him; his words were: 'If once
one starts thrashing the little beast, I don't see
where it's going to end,'&mdash;; I therefore decided
that it was incumbent on me, as the one person
whom Miss Phenton had consulted, to administer
such a lesson that your son would remember
it to the end of his days.  Having the good
fortune to meet him in the street this afternoon,
I invited him to come home with me and&mdash;be
whipped!"
</p>

<p>
My attention had wandered a little in preparing
a speech for my Lord Culroyd the next
time he does me the honour to call; but I saw
Sir Appleton jerk his head towards the table
and, to my <i>horror</i>, I beheld an enormous
crop made, I should think, of rhinoceros-hide.
</p>

<p>
"I regret to inform you that it may not be
necessary," said Sir Appleton.  "When I told
our young friend to prepare for execution, he
asked naturally enough why he was being
executed and quite convinced me that it would
be absurd to carry out the sentence when his
one burning desire and ambition was to marry
Miss Phenton."
</p>

<p>
Sheer, unabashed intimidation!
</p>

<p>
I looked at Will; but he was sitting with
his head between his hands, utterly worn out
with the worry of the past few weeks.
</p>

<p>
"Is this true?," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"He will tell you," said Sir Appleton,
taking care to give him no chance of speaking
for himself, "that he always intended to marry
her; he now clearly remembers promising to
marry her, which is so satisfactory.  It was only
a question of times and seasons and ways and
means.  I admit it is not a solution which I
consider ideal, because I&mdash;like you, though from
another standpoint&mdash;do not regard it as a wholly
suitable match.  A first love, however, is not
an easy thing to overcome, and Miss Phenton
is unaffectedly devoted to your son despite the
period of anxiety through which he unavoidably
compelled her to pass; your son will tell you
that he is no less devoted to her."
</p>

<p>
If only the man would have stopped talking
for one moment!  He sat there, smiling to
himself and pouring out this stream of
pretentious, shop-walker's English...  I'm sure
you know what I mean!  One so often finds
with people who are not quite certain of
themselves that they heap up affectations and dare
not venture on a colloquialism for fear of
seeming what they would call "ungenteel".
<i>Slang</i> I abhor, but there <i>is</i> such a thing as the
daily speech of educated men and women...
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, dear Will," I begged, "whether
this is true."
</p>

<p>
"I've always wanted to marry Molly," he
answered.  And, though sheer fatigue had taken
the tone from his voice, I heard a throb of
conviction.  "I didn't see, though, how we could
marry until we had something to marry on.
That's what I told her fool of a father
... and her ... and the guv'nor ... and Sir
Appleton.  If you'd settle that between you
instead of badgering me, I'll marry her
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
His nerves were strained to breaking-point...
</p>

<p>
And I am not ashamed to confess that I
felt hardly adequate to discussing the most
momentous decision in my boy's life.  After
inviting me to dinner, Sir Appleton seemed to
have forgotten all about it.  Nine o'clock had
struck; and I was faint and <i>sick</i> with hunger.
I have reached an age when I like regular meals
at regular hours.  These business men must
have iron constitutions; or else they must eat
very hearty luncheons.  And I kept saying to
myself: "For <i>truly</i> unbusinesslike irregularity,
go to your business man." ...
</p>

<p>
One thing stood out clearly.  As I have
always refused to <i>lead</i> Will where his affections
were concerned, so I could never stand in the
way when once his heart had spoken.
</p>

<p>
"We must not worry him," I told Sir
Appleton.  "Cannot you and I talk over ways
and means together?  I have no idea what to
suggest.  As you know, my husband and I are
paupers..."
</p>

<p>
<i>He</i>, if any one, after all that he had taken
upon himself, was the man to help us out of
our difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"I have a scheme," he said, "but your
son had better hear it, as he will be a party
to it."
</p>

<p>
I could have gone on my knees to him for
a crust of bread...  It could hardly have been
deliberate&mdash;this policy of starvation&mdash;, but I
was <i>strongly</i> reminded of very similar treatment
from a certain general in the War Office ...
who shall be nameless.  You remember my
difficulty about Will's commission; he was on
<i>fire</i>, of course, to go into the infantry.  "Do
you," I asked him, "think you are serving your
country by spending one day in the trenches
and six months in hospital with rheumatic
fever?"  And, when I had <i>wasted</i> argument
and entreaty on <i>him</i>, I carried my appeal to
Cæsar.  On the <i>staff</i> my boy would have been
worth his weight in gold; anything else was
simply a short cut to hospital.  I told this
general ... when at <i>last</i> I contrived to see
him; and his method of receiving me was to
keep me standing&mdash;not a chair to be seen
in the room!&mdash;with all the windows open,
a gale blowing and no fire.  I made him see
reason at the end, but I was in bed for a
week afterwards...  I wondered whether
Sir Appleton was trying to starve me into
submission...
</p>

<p>
His plan...  I wish you could have heard
it in his own words!  The impudence and
brutality...
</p>

<p>
"If you've no money yourself, Lady Ann,"
he said, "you've rich relations.  Lord Brackenbury,
I am sure, would give a substantial sum
to start his nephew in life.  And so would your
brother-in-law, Lord Spenworth.  I have spoken
to both and demonstrated that your son will be
at the other side of the world for probably a
number of years with no opportunity of coming
to them, as in the past, when he needed
assistance.  They both seemed disposed to help, but
felt that the first step should be taken by you.
I have ascertained that the lease of your
house&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You would like," I interrupted, "to sell
the roof over my head!  Why not the clothes
off my back?"
</p>

<p>
"There is a great scarcity of houses," he
said, "and you would get a good price.
Besides, with your son married and away you
will not have the same need for a big house in
London...  When the fund has been collected,
it will be settled on Miss Phenton, as it is her
position that requires safeguarding; you have
assured me of your son's abilities, so he should
have no difficulty in making a big income in
the position which I contemplate offering him.
If he fails, it will be his own fault; but, as I
never believe in bolstering up failures, his wife
must be made independent of his success in
business.  If you consent to this in principle
and will empower me to work out the details,
your son's appointment is secured, and he can
sail for China as soon as he can get a passage.
Let us now go in to dinner, or Miss Phenton
will be wondering what has happened to us."
</p>

<p>
I felt <i>then</i> that he had decided to break me
at all costs, one shock after another.  <i>Forcing</i>
Will into marriage, <i>driving</i> him abroad, calmly
proposing that I should denude myself of
everything&mdash;and then throwing me face to face with
this girl.  I tried to protest...  And then I
knew that, if he did not give me something to
eat, I should simply break down...
</p>

<p>
I had met the girl before, of course&mdash;just
for a moment, hardly long enough to take in
more than a general view, "the old clergyman's
pretty little daughter", if you understand me...
Big grey eyes and a quantity of soft hair;
a shy, appealing girl...
</p>

<p>
"Won't you leave us alone for a moment?,"
I said to Sir Appleton.  Rather to my surprise
he <i>did</i> have the consideration to oblige me in
that.  "Molly, my dear, won't you kiss me?,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
The poor little thing shrank from me...
</p>

<p>
"I'm so <i>ashamed</i>," she cried.
</p>

<p>
"My child, my child," I said, "you are
overwrought.  But we are going to send you
right away, where you will forget all your
troubles.  All will be well.  All would have
been well from the beginning if you had trusted
me and taken me into your confidence."
</p>

<p>
"I felt you'd think me so wicked!," sobbed
the poor little thing.
</p>

<p>
I told her that I couldn't think <i>her</i> wicked
without thinking the same of Will.
</p>

<p>
"Right and Wrong," I said, "existed from
the beginning and will endure to the end,
irrespective of conventions and institutions.  I say
to you what I should not dare say to your father:
right and wrong are older than any marriage
laws.  You love my boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do," she cried.  "I never loved
any one before and I could never love any one
else."
</p>

<p>
"And he loves you," I said.  "Need we
say any more at present?  I find it hard to
spare him, but sooner or later this is a thing
that comes to every mother.  If I surrender him
to you, will you in your turn take my place and
devote yourself to him as I have tried to do?
There is so little time and so many things to
do that I cannot talk to you as I should like.
Very soon you will be married, very soon you
will both have slipped away to a very far country.
Nothing that any of us can do for you both will
be left undone; every penny that we can scrape
together will be yours.  As time goes on, you
will learn how much money can do&mdash;and how
little.  All my life I have been scraping and
pinching, pinching and scraping to provide for
the happiness and comfort of my husband and
son.  You will have to do the same.  Very few
of us have enough for all we should like, and
you will find that between husband and wife,
when one has to yield, it is the wife who yields.
That is the law of the Medes and Persians.  Too
often it is 'A suit for him <i>or</i> a frock for
me'...  Promise me that you will never let
my boy go short of anything.  He has been
brought up to a certain standard of comfort, and
I know by experience that, if you try to reduce
that, it will be you who will suffer in the long
run.  That is part of the price that we pay for
being women.  And now," I said, "let me kiss
my daughter."
</p>

<p>
I do not wonder that my boy fell in love
with her.  <i>You</i> will, too, the moment you see
her.  As Arthur did...  There is nothing much
more to tell you about our dinner with Sir
Appleton; when he <i>did</i> allow us to begin, I will
say that he tried to make amends for any
exhibition of what I had better call the business
manner.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when I reached home, I found
that I had only got rid of one trouble to make
way for another.  Arthur...  He would have
been even more furious if he had been less
bewildered, but, as it is, I try to forget and I
shall certainly not remind him of certain things
that he said about my going to work behind his
back, taking decisions over his head.  When one
has grown <i>attached</i> to a house...  Is it not my
frame and setting?  Is not every corner filled,
for me, with memories of the old days when
the princess almost lived with us?  There was
an entirely <i>meaningless</i> explosion at the expense
of poor Will, who very properly refused to be
drawn into argument and went straight to bed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Arthur," I said, "sooner or later
this was inevitable.  When our boy married, we
knew that we should have to go on providing
for him.  Is it so great a sacrifice that we should
move into a smaller house, that you, perhaps,
should have to work longer than you had
intended?  It is to establish our son in life."
</p>

<p>
When the announcement was published, I
invited just the family to a little informal dinner.
They were <i>extravagant</i> in their praise of
Molly&mdash;Spenworth in his hyperbolical manner going
so far as to tell her that she was "chucking
herself away", as he elegantly put it, on some
one who was not good enough for her.  I should
have thought it possible to pay a compliment
without trying to be rude to as many other
people as possible...
</p>

<p>
To do Spenworth justice, he behaved liberally
over the money, though he must needs be
facetious and tell Will that he would pay twice
the sum to <i>keep</i> him out of England.  Such
humour is a little <i>primitive</i>...  I acquit Brackenbury,
too, of any illiberality, though Spenworth
must needs call this a "thank-offering"
... for some reason...
</p>

<p>
The marriage, of course, takes place
immediately, as they sail the moment Sir Appleton
can arrange about their passages.  I am sure
that it will be a success, though I prefer not
to think about it; dearly as I love little Molly,
she <i>is</i> robbing me of my boy.  As soon as they
leave England, I shall go right away for a
time.  What with one thing and another, the
last year has been very exhausting, and Arthur
and I have to prepare for a new life and a
very different life.  The old and the new are
bridged by one's friends...  Their love follows
us into what must inevitably be <i>retirement</i> from
the stage on which we have played our little
part for our few years...  We are abandoning
any little <i>niche</i> that we may have occupied...
</p>

<p>
<i>You</i> I hope to see constantly.  At the
ceremony, of course, and afterwards here...  The
princess is coming.  Whoever appeals to <i>her</i>
graciousness and devotion will never appeal in
vain...

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
